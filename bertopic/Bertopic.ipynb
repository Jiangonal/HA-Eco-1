CalendarEvent already handles this and adds 1 day so i thought it might be unnecessary It\\'s there just to fix input bugs, and is shared with the input handling code for creating events from the service.  You can just use `dt_util.now()` here and it will give you a local datetime in the current timezone as described here #get-events  But that\\'s exactly what i need, a tz-aware datetime representation of today (starttime 0:00) for rrule to return also events for today. Is that `dt_util.start_of_local_day()`? lol, that method does the exact same thing 😂\\r\\n(now that I know this exists, I\\'d preferably use that instead) This doesn\\'t seem quite right to me since it is potentially hiding additional upcoming events? Current the rules are this returns either the current or next upcoming CalendarEvent.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe a simple way to implement \"active after\" is to iterate over the sorted event list and find the first event where the start time or end time are greater than the \"now\" time like here #L371 (used by local_calendar) I would recommend implementing this logic for the upcoming event and the event date range search once, and just make each type of event supply a sorted list of `CalendarEvent` and hand the rest with shared code.  Having the variance between them may introduce some bugs if we don\\'t find all the subtle differences here so its easier to just get them right once and do them the same way.  (The logic can be the same whether or not its an all day event just by converting the dates to a timezone aware date when doing the range comparison) I think i still need some tweeking for the reminders calendar, I\\'m considering adding them in a follow-up PR It\\'s not implementing the spec correctly. I see, you removed from the pr. There are two changes needed here i think to meet the spec described here  #get-events\\r\\n\\r\\n(1) the end date is exclusive.\\r\\n(2) This need to check if the event end date is between requested start and end dates.\\r\\n The events don\\'t have enddates, so it is not necessary to check if the enddate is in between.  All calendar events have an end date. I understand the habitica tasks/events don\\'t, but i\\'m talking about how its represented as a home assistant event.  They set an end date  (\"start + timedelta(hours=1)\".) This is not implementing the get events spec correctly \"The start_date is the lower bound and applied to the event\\'s end (exclusive).\" I removed the reminders for now as there are still some other things i have to figure out about how they work in Habitica, the to-dos and dailies are all-day events so i think this doesn\\'t apply to them.  Will this prevent future occurrences from showing up here? As I was saying before for the other event type, a single  timeline view will ensure we don\\'t have inconsistent behavior. the future occurrences should still show up, just for the current day they should not show up after beeing completed I must admit, that was a very good catch. Now it does what it is expected to do 😁\\r\\n\\r\\nI think i can\\'t use a single timeline as you suggest, the future recurrences are generated events. In `async_get_events` i can use end_date to limit how many recurrence events are generated, but in the `events` property I only ask `rrule` for the next recurrence of each task. I would have to provide an arbitrary date in the future. How far into the future would i have to go if want to get sure to get the next recurrence of a task? If it is too close in the future i could miss recurrences. If it is too far in the future i would get a very long list of events for daily recurring tasks. What\\'s the intent behind `[30:]`? Skipping the first line of a multi-line rrule or something? This is pretty subtle, can this be done another way (or omitted)? This is stripping  the dtstart part of the rrule. Otherwise the calendar is unable to parse the rule. I was looking for a method to get a rule from rrule without the dtstart part but couldn\\'t find one  Two suggestions:\\r\\n- I would suggest extracting a descriptive function name that describes what this is doing. (I happy to know the format this library produces includes dtstart because i\\'ve read that library code before, but not sure that is obvious to other readers)\\r\\n- I think there may be a newline in there as a delimiter. Explicitly checking the rrule prefix would help too.  Adding tests would also be useful. Can you help me understand what the intent is here behind this check? Is `everyX` sometimes `0`? (Seems like the rrule would want to handle this, so not sure i follow this) yes, there are dailies without a recurrence, they are called grey dailies and they can be completed whenever but become never due.\\r\\nrrule seems to not be able to parse that. Does that mean they show up every day? or more? If so then maybe that can be set in the rrule on the dailies list in habitica all tasks show up, by default, although one can filter for dailies that are due or grey(completed or not due today). It is still possible to complete dailies that are not due to get the reward but they won\\'t cause damage if they are not completed, so technically grey tasks are optional. An task without a recurrence is always optional, so I think they shouldn\\'t show up in the calendar at all. I must correct myself, `rrule` is not to blame, it can parse a 0 interval correctly, it\\'s Home Assistant that freaks out, i think it\\'s getting into an infinite loop somewhere This also is not meeting the get_event spec. get_events should work for any  start/end date range. A calendar can render events from the past as well, and triggers work based on past events. In Habitica the start of the day can be set to a different time (in my account it is 4:00 am for example. If at that time all dailies that were due have been completed the cron runs at 4 and resets all dailies, marking the start of the day. If there are incompleted dailies from the past day (called yesterdailies), the user gets a last chance to mark tasks as completed (in case the task was done but forgotten to mark as completed) and then the user presses the button \\'start my day\\', which then marks the start of the day. That\\'s what I want to reflect here. \\r\\nThat\\'s also why it doesn\\'t make sense to render events from the past, dailies are reset every day. ',\n",

Why are we comparing it to the `entity_id` in the first place? Users should call their entities by their name, not id.

Likewise with the `constraints.area_name` underneath: if an entity by that name wasn\\'t in the area, we would have never reached the exposure check (failing instead with `MatchFailedReason.NAME`).\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have to be careful to put device class and domain last (in that order), because some intent sentences provide the domain when matched (e.g., #L6).

Correct, this is a virtual remote for sending commands to clients. Does the linked doc PR clarify this? If not, let me know if there\\'s anything there that can be improved.

I\\'m assuming there was a reason `JellyfinMediaPlayer` was based off of the server-based `JellyfinEntity` so my default stance was not to change that.\\r\\n\\r\\nIMO it makes sense having the server be the base: all entities ultimately are linked (at least conceptually) to the Jellyfin server, with some also being linked to individual clients.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Because now the JellyfinEntity requires an entity description, which results in that we only create a small RemoteEntityDescription for the key, and even though it works, we don\\'t really have a good reason to create one.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy understanding is we want to pass the descriptor to help determine the entity type (e.g. `MediaPlayerEntityDescription` for `JellyfinMediaPlayer` vs. `RemoteEntityDescription` for `JellyfinRemote`). So that information needs to be passed in or set somewhere. Oh but that doesn\\'t matter here, because your `JellyfinRemote` inherits `RemoteEntity` and the mediaplayer `MediaPlayer` entity. We usually use entity descriptions to create 1 generic entity class and change the data and appearance of that entity with injecting an entity description, but that is not the case with the remote When doesn\\'t it support this identifier? Capabilities are reported by clients, some clients can be ephemeral without a persistent identifier (they don\\'t send a device-id back when talking with the Jellyfin server).

To me the main reason to use `EntityDescription` data classes was to have a [unified class](#L373-L406) for the Platform to make it easier for entities to be added in the future since a developer or user would only need to add an item to the appropriate tuple instead of duplicating a class and changing its logic.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeparate classes also make it similar to the current method of adding entities which, as you've probably seen in the switch entity, can make adding additional entities complicated and add more duplicate code than necessary.

In our previous PR in which we had a switch we followed this order and there were no issues about that Consider a preliminary PR where you create a shared base entity Hi, what do you mean exactly? You\\'d like an extra abstraction that both the IottySwitch and the IottyShutter inherit from?\\r\\nI think that\\'s an interesting approach, but since the guidelines on the docs are not really clear about what should and what should not be done I preferred going for the simple approach It\\'s not something in the docs but in the code, check AirGradient for an example Looks clear enough to me based on the example you are proposing. Is it mandatory to do it before this PR? I\\'d rather do it afterwards, especially because with two entities it would be easier to refactor later and find the correct common denominator for the base class, otherwise if I did it starting from the current dev version I would just add a layer of abstraction that references itself only. You can do it in this PR or a separate one upfront  I did it here! This looks really inefficient. can\\'t you keep a list in the cover platform with all the known shutters and just watch out for them? Hi, it\\'s not clear to me what you mean with \\r\\n\\r\\n> keep a list in the cover platform with all the known shutters and just watch out for them\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, this approach is already used in the Switch entity as well, and we didn\\'t have any problems with it. I understand there might be a bit of extra calculations going on here, but there doesn\\'t seem to be any concern in efficiency for the size of the lists involved here Would it make sense to already transform the coordinator data to a key-value dict of all devices? It will remove the need for all these lookups The API returns a list of devices, so every time it gets called we\\'d need to map it into a key-value dict, which would move a bit of the computation there, but definitely improve the performance.\\r\\nSince this is a change that would impact also other parts of the code, I think it would be best suited for a later optimization PR after this one, to stay aligned with the \"1 change per PR\" rule Why are there 2 different devices? Could you please elaborate?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you mean two as in one is `self._iotty_device` and two is `device`, well the first one is the entity state, the other is the newly fetched coordinator data Are they the same object? No, they\\'re not Why don\\'t we set `self._iotty_device` to `device`? Just wanted to emphasize the fields that are actually changing (i.e. `status` and `percentage) vs the ones that are not changing (e.g. `serial_number`, `device_id`). No problem in assigning directly to the new data from the coordinator if you think that\\'s better I think it would be nice if the coordinator would become a map of coordinators instead, and the base entity gets a property for `device` which returns the device from the coordinator.

Moved into the base class Only import things for typing. All function calls on the assist pipeline integration need to be done inside the assist satellite base entity class.  I think everything except the pipeline event callback can be moved into the base class. The VoIP code needs to know the pipeline stage in order to play the tones, send the TTS audio, etc. I think that the device registry entry was already on the entity class. This otherwise is fine.  Is this necessary if we have a property already? Let's require classes to override on_pipeline_event ? (And call super) or maybe make it an abstract method platform entities need to implement. They all have it. And then call that method from on_pipeline_event.  This is reverse logic. The state is determined by the base class by asking if this property is true. It should be abstract and implemented by platform entities  Should muting be a supported feature since VoIP doesn't use it at all ?  This should not have an implementation. It should be abstract. The platform entity will need to ensure the microphone is muted when the method returns. Then when we update state, it checks is_microphone_muted property to determine state.  No need to have an intermediary property. Just always write to _attr_state No need to translate this. Should be handled in UI natively.  Instead of implementing it like this and computing it on the fly, set _attr_supported_features above init instead.

I'm using this in the `make_protocol` function in `voip.py` Can we have entity register its start stream function with VoipDevice inside async added to hass ?

I have too little experience to know what to do use though I think you can scope the target device with `model`. I think I once reviewed this for `yolink` I know, I would have like to just use a number flag like `1024` but then I cant get the services.yaml target->entity->supported_features to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow can I define a specific feature flag so I can filter out a specific entity for the action target? I have removed the filtering of the entity ids (using a entity_id which does not belong to a chime will result in a understandable error).\\r\\nAlthough I would have liked to have filtering on the enity target as well. Why is the target domain a select entity? Wouldn't it be more logical to have a device target? Because I absolutely hate using a device as a target because that will use some random device_id in the call.\\r\\nWhen I then want to swap the device later on (because it is broke and I have a replacement, I bricked the firmware, I upgraded to a simular model with more features etc.) I just remove the old device and set the entity_ids of the new device to the same as the old device.\\r\\n\\r\\nI get back all the history of the old device in the new device enitities, but most importantly all my automations will continue to work as usual since the entity_id is used as target.\\r\\n\\r\\nOtherwise I would have to go trough my 195 automations and 102 scripts to check all the places where I used that device and re-target them to the new device. (ending up with searching trough YAML files for the old device_id, which is not user friendly). Right, but that is a concern that is not specific to reolink. So I don't think that replacing a device should be a reason not to pick this tbh I kind of dislike custom actions/services altogether, hence why I implemented the select entity in the previous PR.\\r\\nbecause:\\r\\n- they are harder to find in my opinion (don't show in the device page)\\r\\n- targeting is not nice (as explained above)\\r\\n- they require a lot more code to implement than just another entity_description in the list of entities. It has been reworked and now works both with device and with entities as targets (and a mix of multiple together).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is become a hell of a lot of code for something which could have been just a simple select entity..... Why do we still allow entities to be selected? Is the device alone not enough? You can always select entities when using the target, I am merely filtering.\\r\\nAnd I did make it work through entities or devices, both work.\\r\\nThat keeps me happy since I can use the entity id :)\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you can also use device_id is you prefer. It's not up to each integration to add other ids than the required id, just for the sake of ease. That should be handled centrally by Home Assistant if we want to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease remove the entity_id selector. Sure I will remove it, ~but it does not make any sense to me.\\r\\nThen you get a target select in the UI in which the user can select devices or entities (or area's or even labels) and when the user selects a entity it will just not do anything.~\\r\\n\\r\\n~Nothing in the UI tell the user to use the device as target and not a entity as target.\\r\\nSeems very confusing to me.~\\r\\n\\r\\nEdit: See post below, now makes sense entity selection has been removed Should we rename it to `play_chime`? It sounds a bit more logical imo done Can we use translatable exceptions? Thanks for the suggestion, did not know that was possible.\\r\\nHave implemented it now. This shouldn't be target. Just add a selector for `device_id`. Sure, that makes more sense. Then the user also can't select entities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough I like the UI style of the target more than the select drop-down.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould be cool if you could just use the target and then somehow specify that only targetting entities is possible.

       " 'Why don\\'t we add all inverters by default? Depending on the setup there may be quite some devices with no or little added value for the user. Me for example, I do have four devices: one inverter (with values of solar yield, that I already get from base setup), one gauge for energy consumption (also already integrated in base setup), one gauge for my heat pump (this one I need) and one relais (can be triggered by solar energy surplus). Based on the SolarLog manual there could be loads more devices be connected. Hence I do not think all devices should be added by default.\\r\\nI thought about adding it in the configuration, but in my view the OptionFlow was a better fit (despite being more complicated to implement). We usually want to go with an approach where we add everything, and people can disable devices if they want I definitely would not like this from a user perspective, but if this is the rule...\\r\\nWould it be an option to copy the step to the initial ConfigFlow, so that the user can decide in the initial setup? \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\\'s an old one but it explains the decision well Thnx. In the reference it is said this applies for data retrieved in one API call. In the case at hand, for every device at least 3 calls are needed (name, consumption, power). The library does only make the calls for enabled devices. Does this still apply? In practice this rule is also applied to integrations getting data from more endpoints. Enphase for example just creates a device for every physical device and that\\'s seen as normal. I can bring this to the core meeting for you and check what they think of this if you want Perhaps this would make sense. I think the alternative to give the user the possibility to choose during the initial setup would also be user-friendly. But I would rather not like to spam the user with loads of unnecessary devices. What does device name return? A user-defined name of the device (can be set in SolarLog configuration) Then we should not have that in the unique id I double-checked in the manual ( and on my SolarLog device and have to correct my above statement.\\r\\nThe device name is automatically detected and according to my understanding cannot be changed by the user. It\\'s possible that it could be changed during the initial detection, but I also have not found a reference for this possibility in the manual either. The device name therefore is immutable. Should we split this class in a SolarLogcontrollerentity and a base entity? This way you don\\'t have to duplicate the _attr_has_entity_name thing (and it looks a bit nicer) Does every inverter have the same data as the controller? No, inverter provide less data points (at the moment solarlog-cli has only implemented yearly consumption(i.e. energy) and power). Some additional data points may follow. Should we duplicate the list to make that difference? Because currently both could contain any key and it would create an entity  According to my understanding L238 makes sure, that only those sensors are created for the specific device, that are also available for this device. Therefore a combined list is leaner and a duplication - well, a duplication... But happy to double the code if you prefer. It\\'s more that the current method comes with an unknown factor. When refactoring integrations, it\\'s always nice to have a view like, okay for this device it will create these entities. But if I understand correctly, the controller can create entity 1, 3 and 4, and the inverter 2 and 3. While if someone looked into the code in a year, one could assume that both the controller and the inverter can create 1, 2, 3 and 4. And even if they have the fixtures from their device, it\\'s sometimes difficult (with an undocumented API) to assume that the device you have, is representable for every device. And there are many ways to do this. Another way could be to add a list of devices that the entity supports to the entity description. (the downside here is that you can\\'t change icon, name or disabled by default per entity per device) or create a separate list for the other device (causing code duplication, but gives more freedom).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there is a lot of overlap, I would pick the first one, but if it\\'s only 1-2-3 entities that are shared, we can just duplicate it The overlap is not yet huge, but it presumably will increase. I will therefore go for option 1. Oh I meant adding a type in code using an enum of some sort `devices=[Device.INVERTER]` or something along those lines. But now that I see that an inverter only has 2 entities with only 1 overlapping, I\\'d almost opt for just creating 2 lists \\r\\nShould not be needed This is not a broad except right? What\\'s extended_data? The general API only exposes basic data. Additional data can be accessed with specific configuration of the solarlog (in particular disabling password protection for user account). This also applies for the devices, therefore those can only be added if the user opted-in for this extended data. These 2 lines are probably too long, so can we assign the `f\"{coordinator.unique_id}-{slugify(coordinator.solarlog.device_name(device_id))}\"` to a local variable before using in both?

I\\'m not sure i follow what i\\'m supposed to understand from this.\\r\\n It\\'s a complex issue that\\'s also covered in the documentation.\\n\\nEssentially some vehicles require an extra layer of security that this integration doesn\\'t currently support using.\\n\\nExplaining that in the error seems too long. Could refer to the documentation maybe as I agree with Allen it\\'s very technical error `Command signing is required, please see integration documentation.`\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes this work? I think this check should be moved into `async_setup_entry` to avoid adding the entity. If none of the commands are supported or not allowed then let\\'s not add the climate entity.  My impression is there are already sensors for a read-only view.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Also I don\\'t think we need logic later to check `raise_for_scope` and `raise_for_signing` and to raise on a command given here we\\'ve already said the feature is not supported. My assumption is that the tests would still pass if those checks were removed given the climate integration won\\'t call the service if the features are not enabled?) There are not sensors for a read only view because they would duplicate the values exposed by the climate entity.\\n\\nThe intent is to use the correct platform so that a user can later decide to add the required scopes and the entity won\\'t have to change.\\n\\nThe approach used here is consistent with Tessie and Teslemetry. There\\'s climate_state_inside_temp which seemed like the important bit.\\r\\n\\r\\nEither way, my other point was there is complexity with these checks later in the entity and I don\\'t think it is needed. My impression is that if the features aren\\'t set the code in the entity for double checking these things won\\'t run because of the missing featuers. My assumption is the tests exercising those aren\\'t actually covering those code paths (could confirm looking at code coverage or the error messages raised). Some of the climate attributes are exposed as sensors yes (forgot about that), but this isnt true for the other platforms for example the lock platform is the only way to see if the vehicle is locked. I dont believe hiding the climate entities is the right outcome, because I know for sure I\\'ll have users raising issues that the climate entity is missing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese cases are covered in tests `test_climate_noscope` and `test_climate_command_signing`.\\r\\n\\r\\n~I dont think I understand your core point because there is no \"double checking\". If there is a reason the integration knows a service call will fail it checks for that before trying to execute it, and only does that at run time.~\\r\\n\\r\\nConceptually this isnt new:\\r\\n#L293\\r\\n Ok I do think I get what you mean by \"double checking\" now. My challenge is that not all service calls can be disabled with support_features.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs your suggestion to remove the `self.raise_for_signing()` and `self.raise_for_scope()` on service calls that are removed with `ClimateEntityFeature(0)`? Ok so you can\\'t disable set HVAC mode since it\\'s not associated with a feature? Presumably because it\\'s a requirement to make a useful climate entity. There is lots of prior art of not creating dummy entities when the user doesn\\'t allow the scopes too fwiw (e.g. other integrations use oauth scopes to decide what to expose).\\n\\nPerhaps simplify to \"read only\" since the details of why it\\'s read only (scopes, code signing, etc) doesn\\'t matter and is set only once. > other integrations use oauth scopes to decide what to expose\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you have an example of what good looks like? Am I meant to created disabled by default sensor entities to cover every single other platform type just incase the user doesnt have scopes? I obviously cannot remove sensor entities based on scopes because that would be a breaking change when scopes change.\\r\\n\\r\\n> Perhaps simplify to \"read only\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNot all commands require signing, so I only `raise_for_signing` on the commands that do. > Do you have an example of what good looks like? \\r\\nThe ones i\\'ve had experience with (Nest, Fitbit, Google Calendar, etc) each follow the user choice during oauth / setup on what permissions are allowed then only expose entities based on that choice. They don\\'t expose placeholder functionality.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not intend to suggest exposing disabled by default sensor entities -- saying the opposite, about only exposing entities based on what was allowed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI did see knx appears to have a notion of a read only climate entity. I noticed it returns a single `hvac_mode` for `hvac_modes`. That may have the side effect that it doesn\\'t allow you to change the mode?\\r\\n\\r\\n> Not all commands require signing\\r\\n\\r\\nWhich commands require only signing or only scopes? The logic looked the same everywhere in climate entity so it didn\\'t seem necessary to be specific and check both. Interesting idea about `hvac_modes` ill give that a shot.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the climate platform everything requires signing, but there are commands in other platforms that dont, however looking at the list its rather small, and when checking the Tesla documentation they now suggest signing for all commands (despite some not being implemented in their own reference implementation), so I can probably remove this distinction.  My impression is that the current style preference is that you add typing on the arguments also given the response is typed too -- so add for vehicle? (We don\\'t do partial method typing).  This comment applies elsewhere also. Fixed, thanks. It seems like this method could be part of the coordinator since its overwriting state currently managed by `_async_update_data`. \\r\\n\\r\\n(Aside: This could also let you get a little fancier with the wake attempts and state related to that. Right now a temperature call may invoke the \\'wake\\' multiple times if it both sets a temperature and sets a mode for example and so you could avoid unnecessary calls to wake up if its been woken up recently already.) >may invoke the \\'wake\\' multiple times\\r\\n\\r\\nThat Isn\\'t possible because I am using an asyncio lock on line 15.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it being outside the coordinator an issue? Its just going to be a bunch of work to refactor both this and Teslemetry to keep things consistent for maintenance.\\r\\n#L13C11-L13C26 I believe that stops them from running concurrently (good), but i think it will still run twice in a row when setting the temperature and setting an hvac mode. Your correct that `wake_up_vehicle` will get called twice but `while vehicle.coordinator.data[\"state\"] != TeslaFleetState.ONLINE:` will equate to false on the second run because the first was successful, did `vehicle.coordinator.data[\"state\"] = state`, and didn\\'t raise HomeAssistantError Ah of course, thanks for the correction. My impression is that turning off a preset mode should turn off a preset but not necessarily turn off the A/C. That is, it would just mean the A/C should be behaving normally without a special mode, but could still be on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs there a specific reason for this or is leaving the hvac mode alone here right? I think this might actually be an edge case bug. Turning off the present shouldn\\'t turn off HVAC, but only if the user is still in the vehicle.\\n\\nIf they are not in the vehicle, the vehicle will turn off the HVAC when preset is off, which is why you typically use a preset like these anyway.\\n\\nI\\'ll rethink this. This line was removed, its a bug.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think most users would never run into this because they wouldn\\'t be using Home Assistant to modify the preset mode when sitting inside their vehicle, but its defintely possible and put the entity into the wrong state. Is `climate_state_climate_keeper_mode` preserved/remembered when the vehicle is turned on/off?\\r\\n\\r\\nGenerally, I\\'m trying to think through what can go wrong given the climate entity is using assumed state to proactive sets attributes that don\\'t come directly from cloud responses (e.g. data update coordinator is no longer the source of truth). I see here this is cleared when turned off but not re-instated when turned on so just want to make sure it works that way where the API clears it on its end also. Preset modes are only used to keep HVAC on after you leave the vehicle, they are never remembered and need to be instantly cleared when HVAC turns off.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy forcing both the HVAC mode and preset mode off at the same time we replicate how the vehicle behavies without having to wait for a coordinator refresh, otherwise Home Assistant would show an impossible state (preset on but HVAC off).\\r\\n\\r\\n Sounds good. Are users expected to know the 3 specific temperatures here? I\\'m curious how this is expected to work. Should set temp be supported at all or might more preset modes make sense here? The Home Assistant UI knows the minimum and maximum and step, so no the user doesn\\'t need to know what the possible values are because that information is communicated to them through the climate card UI.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf they are calling the service directly then I do expect them to know how to read entity attributes or already know about the three levels.\\r\\n\\r\\nI feel it\\'s better to communicate temperatures than Low/Medium/High because a user will likely not know what those levels translate to in the real world.',\n",

Otherwise a select entity could also be used as a remote, where all the buttons are put as options. While it works, its not ideal. So yea, I\\'d argue that playing a sound (and playing that quick text message) is an action and thus should be a service call (or buttons, but I think a service call is more flexible here when reolink adds more sounds or messages, otherwise you might have to add even more entities in the future) For the \"quick replay play\" I just added that entity below my camera stream so I can play a voice message when someone is at the door, no need to create something with services, just add the select entity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed for the play ringtone off the chime it is less likely a user wants to trigger it, but more likely to be used in automations and scripts, but if you use the select.select_option or a custom service really does not matter much.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides having it as an entity on the device page makes it a lot easier to find for users (in my opinion).\\r\\n\\r\\nI agree buttons would be a even better fit, but you end up with way too many buttons....\\r\\n\\r\\nI do like the select entity better, but if you ensist I will remove this entity and implement a service in a future PR. I removed it. Why can the coordinator be None? Because when it is None, the default coordinator will be used (almost all reolink entities use that coordinator).\\r\\nSee #L53-L54 \\r\\nYou can remove the list creation and use a generator expression  Thanks for the suggestion, I removed the list for all platforms of the reolink integration.

If you just want to test the service call you can just remove the receive of the event. Is that what you mean? The sent commands depend on the current state (brightness / color) of the light, so having the correct state before calling the service is necessary.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese assertions depend on how many calls were done before, which introduces coupling between the sub-tests\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nso I'm looking for a way to reset the call history, but not the entire mock state. You can use `reset_mock` on the mock attribute that you want to reset. Ok so just `client.async_send_command.call_args_list.reset_mock()`? No, `client.async_send_command.reset_mock()`. Ohhh, I think the issue is actually not related to that. I am using this call already, but I thought it was resetting the Z-Wave values aswell. However the test sets the `targetColor`, but there's no machinery in place to update the `currentColor` afterwards. Side note: We should replace the standard light entity attributes and properties with `self._attr_color_mode` etc in the future, where appropriate. I had to do this because `scale` is considered `float | None`, even after the definitive assignment here. The suggestion causes an error on the line where `scale` is multiplied.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe there's a different trick I'm not aware of, like TypeScript's non-null assertion? Ok. Please use keywords when passing a `None` value so it's easier to read what parameters we're using. Do we need to get this value a new on every call to turn off or can we store the value as an instance attribute?  I guess we can cache it in `_calculate_color_values`, but I was under the impression that this is just a simple lookup. If it's the same instance there's no point in looking it up more than once. I'm missing an assertion of the entity state after this event. Otherwise we can remove this call. This will error if the list is empty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we know that this light always supports red, green and blue colors, ie we don't have to worry about an empty list here, it's weird that we check `self._supports_color` in this class.

I’ve seen that there is a use of it in other atlantic devices.

I agree, but this is a crucial aspect of our measuring devices. It is a bit complicated, so let me explain it further.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll our devices, including energy meters and power quality analyzers, have energy counters that measure electrical energy. These devices contain a few non-resettable energy counters, which users cannot reset, and a few resettable ones. This is why there are two `for` loops in the code.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Resettable Counters\\r\\n- **Customizable by User**: Users can configure each resettable counter to measure:\\r\\n  - Imported or exported energy\\r\\n  - Active, reactive, or apparent energy\\r\\n  - Total energy or energy for a specific phase of the meter\\r\\n\\r\\n- **Example Use Case**: This customization can be particularly handy. For instance, a user can set a load such as a central heat pump on one phase and a sanitary heat pump on another phase. They can then see the consumption of each load with one energy meter, as well as the total consumption for the whole heating system.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Non-resettable Counters\\r\\n- **Customizable by Buyer**: Larger companies or distributors that purchase from us can customize these counters. However, users cannot reconfigure them during the product's lifetime.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code checks if the counter type is active energy and, if so, sets the device class to Home Assistant's `SensorDeviceClass.Energy` and the unit of energy to `Watt_HOUR`. Otherwise, it uses the API's units. This ensures compatibility with the Energy tab in Home Assistant.\\r\\n At this moment it's still a blur for me as the code isn't that readable and I can't completely link to whats going on. I don't think we can make 2024.8 (for which the beta cut is wednesday), so let's aim for 2024.9. so in theory we have enough time and I think it would speed up the process to get the way we fetch data and how we create entities straight in this PR and add the extra logic in followups (and then we can do it in understandable bit size pieces).

If we are not doing anything special here, let's combine the two flows as we usually do.\\r\\nso:\\r\\n The intention was to have async_step_pairing() as a common call for both the `user` step and `import` step to reduce duplicate code. My other two solutions would be:\\r\\n1) Duplicating connection logic (or making separate connection logic, which is what the pairing step represents) between the user and import steps.\\r\\n2) Combining user and pairing step into one, and calling user step from data passed from import step. I thought this might be visually confusing, so went with the former.  Oh I missed that this was also used in the import step. I personally always like to duplicate it, because it will be removed eventually, and you have to abort the flow in the case of an import flow instead of returning errors with the form. Yep, I did the abort to be able to combine the logic. If returning the errors is the expected behavior for the user step, I'll separate the logic. Logic has been separated.  I think we can support multiple integrations from the start tbh Let's do this in a followup Same for these changes Please extend the typing of ConfigEntry as seen in [the blog post]( Please type this no need for the extra When do we expect to get this? We will get a NoPrimaryControllerException when there is a connected controller that does not have an ID of one.\\r\\n\\r\\n**To provide context:**\\r\\nThe Russound MCA-C5 can be daisy chained (using their proprietary serial connection) up to six total units. On the rear of each unit, there is a dip switch to select the ID of the unit (1-6). Per the unit and API's instructions, only the first logical unit (Unit 1) can be interfaced over IP. In our use case, we treat all the daisy chained controllers to the primary one single device since that's how it's intended by the manufacturer. It's possible for someone to have a single unit on ID 2 that is hooked up to HA over IP. The API doesn't function properly (as expected) in this case so this is caught here to ensure that all controller stack-ups have at least the primary controller present.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis exception may become irrelevant when I pull the logic out of the try-except-else since I was using it as a way to reach the except block. Cleaned this up so that NoPrimaryControllerException is raised directly by the find_primary_controller_metadata method. Leaving this open for discussion / clarifications if there are any. Let's try to keep everything out of the `try` block that can't raise. If I am correct you can connect, enumerate controllers and close and move everything else to the `else:` Moved the set unique ID out of the method. You are correct on those three methods. I also made the find_primary_controller_metadata method return the exception directly so that is able to remain put. Let's not do this, because if I still have the YAML and I deleted the imported config entry, and created a new one, because I got a new IP address (its a bit tricky, but it explains it well), it would overwrite that entry with the YAML (old) info The homeasssitant domain already has the deprecation issue ready, so we should use that one. checkout the `mpd` `media_player.py` for a flow like that This is functionally identical to the MDP impl.

       " 'we need to guard for invalid data here as we have seen devices in the wild with malformed data in the hardwareAddress field. So my proposal is to convert this entire block into a small helper util which guards for invalid mac addresses (or the convert_mac_address util erroring) Thanks for the review. \\n\\nI\\'ll look into it shortly. Hey, \\r\\n\\r\\nI looked into it and maybe there is more to it…\\r\\nMaybe you can elaborate on those _malformed addresses_ and what the concern is here.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the matter lib will always return `bytes` for the `hardwareAddress`, a malformed mac address is not a problem, and you only have to check for excessive size. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut that leads me to another thing, namely: _What is a valid mac address?_\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at:\\r\\n#L420-L437\\r\\n\\r\\nIt assumes a 48bit address. But IEEE 802.15.4 (or any other new standard) uses EUI-64, 64bit addresses, which is `CONNECTION_ZIGBEE = \"zigbee\"` in HA, although this is not exclusive to ZigBee and a device should either have a EUI-48 (traditional MAC) or a EUI-64. So there isn\\'t really a need to differentiate between the two. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also the `CONNECTION_BLUETOOTH = \"bluetooth\"` connection type, which is also a EUI-48 from the same pool of addresses. \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n**Back to the topic of malformed hardware addresses.**\\r\\nA problem would arise (that HA currently doesn\\'t seem to account for, and it\\'s not specific to the matter integration) if the device reports a mac address that\\'s not a valid identifier for an individual device. A NULL address, such as `00:00:00:00:00:00`, has the potential to match a bunch of devices. Also, at least half the mac addresses are multicast addresses, also unsuitable for device identification. \\r\\n\\r\\nSince this is not matter specific, this should ideally be handled by the \"core\" HA code.\\r\\nThese checks should be made by the device_registry.  This is a bit overkill and doesn\\'t belong here in an individual integration.\\r\\nFrom an architectural perspective I would propose this at the core level.\\r\\n\\r\\n I agree, that\\'s why I added the comment to your earlier review. #discussion_r1668494242\\r\\n\\r\\nCan you tell me where such discussions about architecture best belong? It doesn\\'t feel like a bug report or a feature request. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end, it\\'s not that important to me, I just noticed it and am bad at ignoring it. (As evident by the over-engineered code 🙂) Well, you could just make a draft PR against HA core and get feedback (or a merge that way) but if it needs a bit discussion first, its probably best to raise a discussion here:  This was all I meant with my review feedback - just a try..except around the code that reads the mac address into a mac address string (as that can be an empty string or malformed junk) to not blow up setting up a device `GeneralDiagnostics.Structs.NetworkInterface.hardwareAddress` are (possibly empty) `bytes`. I guard against `None` and empty here.\\r\\n\\r\\n`convert_mac_address` takes these bytes, formats and concatenates them. The result is a string in the format (`\"xx:xx:xx:...\"`).\\r\\n\\r\\nI check that the string has an appropriate length for EUI-48 or EUI-64 addresses and set the connection type accordingly. Further normalisation is done by the HA core code.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as I can see, there is nothing that can go wrong, except if the matter/chip library itself is buggy and doesn\\'t adhere to their types. \\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t know what to catch except a broad `Exception` and move on.  Let\\'s do it this way, you guard for empty values which is (imo) enough. If something unexpected can happen later, we will learn soon enough and can act on it then.\\r\\n\\r\\nBTW: I still like your proposal for the validation of the addresses so I advice you to try raising that discussion and/or open a draft PR to fix the device registry.',\n",

So you would have two sets of devices, but there's no way to distinguish what devices are a part of what installation from the advertisement data and even with the local API, there's no way to determine if a device is part of installation A or installation B without comparing the device list of multiple devices. Can you elaborate on this? \\n> the discovered devices menu is flooded with all the devices that could be the bridge. Yeah so I have access to a larger installation of Deako devices (>100) and due to their behavior with getting online to check in, there are always more than 10 online at a time roughly. \\r\\n\\r\\nBy removing the constraint that there can only be one active config flow via the DOMAIN, the discovered section in the integrations menu will now have all the devices listed as separate Deako integrations. We only need one to act as the bridge, so having all those listed there is misleading. And why should we connect to a bridge if we can also talk to the device directly? Not every device is guaranteed to be on the network and often most devices are not. The bridge device gives us two things:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. the list of all known devices, whether on the network or not\\r\\n2. access to the encrypted BLE mesh network for control requests\\r\\n\\r\\n How can we detect if the device is a bridge? Good question! Any device that's on the network _can_ be the bridge device. The device that _is_ selected as the bridge device (aka connected to with a socket) will no longer advertise I believe.  I would have to confirm with the firmware team. No but how do you know if the zeroconf message is the one sent by the bridge? All of the zeroconf advertisements are sent from devices that aren't the bridge, just ones that could be the bridge. This flow is essentially bridge selection where the first device that advertises is the bridge. Mind sharing the zeroconf debug logs? Like I think I start to know what you're getting at, but I want to be sure. So I talked to firmware team, device continues to advertise when it's connected to as the bridge, but I think that's fine for the integration's use cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll get you some zeroconf logs on the larger installation that I have access to.

Yes you mentioned that before but i still think that this will not work. \\r\\nThe problem when using an input controller is that you can not specify 'generic' inputs, only predefined values by alexa (TV, HDMI, DVD, etc.). The input controller already tries to match the given source_list to the allowed values but this does not work for the activities of the remote, because those activities can be anything.\\r\\nThe mode controller on the other hand supports any kind of names for an activity. If you really insist on using the input controller instead of the mode controller we should think about a way on how to match an activity name with an allowed alexa input controller value.\\r\\nMy first idea for that would be to let the user do that themselves. The user could create a mapping in the configuration that maps an activity to an alexa value.\\r\\nThe downside is that the user has to know which values are allowed and that it does not work out of the box.     `remote.ATTR_PRESET_MODE` does not exist.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMay be add a comment why we use a mode controller in stead of an input controller here.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease also add a test case so this code covered.

Or can it be unknown because its not supported? Technically it\\'s not possible. Per the documentation, anything outside of the values we have is \"reserved\", which means that it theoretically is a value supported by the protocol, but doesn\\'t actually ever happen. The \"off\" is really just a failsafe. Stale Stale Maybe just create the inverse maps as a constant outside the class as well That would require adding a new parameter as well. Is there any real benefit to having the inverse maps as constants that then get passed in, as opposed to just generating the inverse map in the init? Can be combined',\n",

Is it possible to relate the name of the numeric input to the control it relates to. I.e., if the user names the control \"Living Room\", is it possible for the numeric input to have that appended like (\"OnLevel for Living Room\"). That may be the least confusing if it was possible.\\r\\n- Another approach that is likely better than using the \"EP\" would be to do what you did with events and see if there is a matching FixedLabel and append that value if a match can be found (or use the first label in FixedLabel as a default), but only append the \"EP\" if no match and the device has multiple endpoints.\\r\\n- Longer term, I had thought there needs to be some kind of naming \"helper\" function as a more general naming function that does something like : See if there is a semantic value taglist and, if so, translate the semantic value to use in the entity name, or see if there is a FixedLabel and find one matching target labels  [X, Y, Z], or if no target label match in FixedLabel, use the first label as the name, or if nothing else, return an endpoint number.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, I agree with the point that that I put in isn\\'t ideal, but less confusing than if there are duplicates with no way to distinguish.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Opened a PR with a more generic approach to postfix the entity name, but only if the device actually has multiple endpoints:\\r\\n\\r\\n This needs to be changed to avoid a rounding issue.\\r\\nShould have been :\\r\\nmeasurement_to_ha=lambda x: int(x / 2.54 + 0.5)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs is, if you entered the value of 54 percent, it would get converted to the native value 137, and that would then get reported back and coverted as Int (137/2.54) = 53.

Understandable that there are many, many knobs that could be turned on Ollama and its probably better to not overwhelm the user.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy thinking on this one was that different users could have pretty substantially different setups and usage patterns. I did a decent amount of testing, and at least on my hardware (1080ti, i7-4770K, SSD), the latency from loading the llama3 model into memory was surprisingly negligible. However, having 44% of my GPU RAM tied up by something only used a handful of times per day was much more limiting. I'd can imagine at least 3 classes of users:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) High performance seekers: potentially serving many users and likely using dedicated hardware. Current value of -1 probably best fit.\\r\\n2) Hobbyists/recent adopters: probably deploying on a desktop computer they use for daily work/computing. Having a big chunk of GPU RAM tied up probably infeasible if they ever want to play a video game or other intensive tasks. Values of 0 - X minutes probably ideal.\\r\\n3) Budget homelabbers with either a raspberry pi or mini pc. Potentially deploying Ollama using CPU instead of GPU. I'm actually not sure what the performance characteristics would look like here. I'd _guess_ values of -1 or 0 would be undesirable here but not sure.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also wanted to leave room for customization as new models come out. Even if llama3:8B loads up quick, it's possible models in the next few months get unwieldy. I can envision someone running a massive model on a device with unified memory wanting to avoid reading from disk.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving it up to the configuration of the Ollama instance could make sense, as this can be easily adjusted with the `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE` env variable. So I am leaning to just letting users use `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE`. Mike is currently out so let's wait until he is back next Thursday. I set the keep alive to -1 with the assumption that for HA users would not want to pay the cost of loading a model every time it wasn't used for 5 minutes. When used in a voice pipeline, the delay of a few seconds is a bit annoying.\\r\\nI'm fine making this configurable, but I'd like to keep the default at -1 even if Ollama themselves use 5 minutes. But we could let users configure Ollama with -1, instead of having this option in HA We could, but I would argue Ollama's default is not right for HA. I was confused when first building the integration because my models kept getting unloaded. Ultimately deferring to you both, my two cents is that Ollama can be used by multiple users for multiple services. The right default behavior for a Home Assistant only setup won't necessarily scale to other configurations. Having Home Assistant impose an immutable default behavior that impacts the whole system running Ollama might be a bit overkill. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe other edge case is that setting -1 in the Home Assistant request doesn't actually guarantee the model will remain indefinitely in memory. If the Ollama host receives a Home Assistant request is followed by another request (e.g., Open Webui), it will overwrite the -1 with with the value passed by the other service. Which can put you in a situation where the defaults of each service ping pong and overwrite each other. In Open Webui, keep_alive is [configurable](#L634)\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps being user-configurable like Open Webui is the more congruent approach? I'd be happy to modify this PR to simply switch the default from 5m to -1. If that is desirable, should I rebase and force push overwriting this branch? Or merge in dev, then commit a change moving 5m to -1? I'm fine with making the keep alive configurable, but I think we should default to -1 in HA I've pushed two commits to this PR:\\r\\n1.

In December 2023 an update was rolled out to fix this for every other type of vehicle, so I only need to account for these older vehicles by pausing updates for 15min when it appears the vehicle has been idle for 15min. My point is only that if a user turns off polling and does it himself by using the `update_entity` service this disregards from whatever you\\'re setting here internally in the integration.\\r\\nTherefore my thinking is if you should handle this in another form than using the `update_interval` variable. As example maybe just look at the datetime of last refresh and then don\\'t allow another update until time + 15 minutes. I\\'m okay with, and would prefer the user is able to override this behavior using `update_entity`. Before this code was implemented (in HACS version) i was advising people to use automations to handle this themselves, and there very well may be people who want to keep doing that so they can have more control over when the sleep is attempted. TLDR I want `update_entity` to work when someone calls it regardless of this code.

Instead of checking the type in `async_setup_entry` I thought it is more efficient to convert it in the config-flow (and now also in the migration).\\r\\n\\r\\nWith regards to saving the epoch, I do not yet see how this could be realized, as one would then also have to save the starting date, otherwise we do not know when the epoch ends.

An advantage could be, if the whole logic would be adapted from current local time to UTC, but this would require a rewrite of the client and integration, and I'm not sure if this is reasonable in the case at hand. The biggest advantage is that epoch is in UTC, so you don't have the whole timezone mess as it just works So instead of saving `2024-12-31T10:00:00+00:00` you're saving `1735603200`.\\r\\n\\r\\nI always find to have a love hate relationship with iso date strings.

The benefit of saving a UTC time (epoch or datetime-string) only applies, if the whole code would be converted from localized datetime to UTC (which would require an adoption of the library as well). As long as we have localized datetime in the middle, we have to handle conversion. > If I look at the changes, we could just replace the way to serialize the timestamps.

But in my view this goes beyond the scope of this PR (which according to my understanding should be as narrow as possible), as said above, it would also need an adjustment of the library. To make my question a bit more explicit: Where does the timezone affect the library? I think I am missing that point here.

If this would be implemented there would be 2 things. \\r\\n\\r\\n1) if the 20 min timer switch is on or off\\r\\n2) if the ventilator is on or off\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ventilator can be on for other reasons than the 20 min switch being on. (exemple the `min ventilator time` number in the integration) \\r\\n\\r\\nBasically the way the device works is. You can configure it to be on x min/hour. `min ventilator time`  and then the ecobee turns it on/off to match that number. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut if you want to give a boost of ventilator, you can turn on the `20 min switch` on the ecobee interface to run it for the next 20 min (regardless of the `min ventilator time` ). The ecobee behaviour is that switch stays on for that 20 min and go off after. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis last piece is what I am adding today.  For what\\'s it\\'s worth, if we wanted a binary_sensor to say if the ventilator is on/off it would be done by another data point call `enabled equipement` which is a coma separated list of all the things on. ex: `fan,ventilator,heat` \\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason I assume nobody ever modeled it, is because of the bad refresh rate of the ecobee device (3 min) it makes it very un-usable Because the thing is, we generally dislike when the integration is assuming the state, so for example if I turn on this switch via HA and then turn it off manually, they are out of sync. Would it maybe fit to be a button instead to avoid keeping state ourselves? tbh, in this case I can just remove that line. The behaviour will be like the rest of this integration, aka the switch will flip to an \"old\" position based on latest data. Then will get updated in the x seconds after. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet me fix the code and remove that part. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt should not change the functionality. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I would like to keep the switch beacuse it is useful to know when the 20 min is done. So folks can use Home Assistant to build timer longer or shorter than 20 min (which is limiting right now with Ecobee HW)  Yea but that\\'s what I meant with the question if we can see the switch being on in other entities, and if I understand correctly, we can the other entity would be on `enabled equipement` and we could not distinguish if the 20 min timer is on. (vs just the ventilator)  I don\\'t really see a reason to differentiate on the reason why the ventilation was turned on. Let me ask someone else to also take a look at this so I\\'m not unneededly pushing this in another direction. > Would it maybe fit to be a button instead to avoid keeping state ourselves?\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, that seems like the best solution.  As we\\'d want the state to be consistent regardless of where the action is taken.  Meaning if the 20 minute vent is initiated / canceled from the panel or HA the state should be the same.   If the ecobee can provide remaining ventilation duration then this could be done; but it appears it does not?  If so, the best is a button to initiate and a binary sensor to report ventilation State.   So the value that we set here get configured by Ecobee servers regardless where the switch is flipped. \\n\\nIn the device or in HA. \\n\\nThe reason we modified that value was for getting a better responsiveness. I will remove the change to this. \\n\\n The thing with a button will be in-ability to turn off the 20 min timer. This is why I think the switch makes more sense.  So if the 20 minute ventilate is set on the panel.  Then the value of \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nwill contain the off time? Yes exactly  In the switch code you set it to 20 minutes in the future.  If you set it to +40 would that then run it for 40 minutes? No.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis line: \\r\\n`self.thermostat[\"settings\"][\"ventilatorOffDateTime\"] = (datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=20) - self._time_zone_delay`\\r\\n\\r\\nis never leaving HA. it was only added to enhance user experience. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only thing that leaves HA is `set_ventilator_timer(id, True)` (or false)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Ecobee receive that command they:\\r\\n- Start the ventilator \\r\\n- configure thermostat[\"settings\"][\"ventilatorOffDateTime\"] to now+20 min. \\r\\n- when that delay is done, they turn off the ventilator. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nwe could have skipped the `self.thermostat[\"settings\"][\"ventilatorOffDateTime\"] = (datetime.now() + timedelta(minutes=20) - self._time_zone_delay` this is not in any way setting the real value it\\'s just an estimate so HA has a temporary value until we get a refreshed value (up to 3 min)\\r\\n Now I understand, that line is an anti-pattern. So I will remove it. But it will not change the behavior of this new switch. (simply the refresh time of it)  and if we send `set_ventilator_timer(id, False)`  then Ecobee server stop the ventilator and set `ventilatorOffDateTime` to \"\" Got it, apologies for it taking so long.  To summarize\\r\\n\\r\\na) there is an api command to turn the \"20 minute ventilator\" (20mv)there are no other options for different time amount.\\r\\nb) there is an api command to stop an in progress 20mv\\r\\nc) the remaining time on the 20mv is reported by the thermostat, the update period is 3 minutes\\r\\nd) the purpose of setting the remaining time in the code above was to make the switch be on while the system is waiting for the update in (c) to come through. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo make it consistent with the panel UI, we\\'d want a way to turn the 20mv on / off, display whether it is on or off and display the remaining time in minutes?\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding (d), I can see why this is useful in order to prevent this scenario:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) user initiates 20mv\\r\\n2) there is no UI feedback that it succeeded (or the UIs optimistic switch reverts back to off after a timeout)\\r\\n3) user does 1 again and again and again...\\r\\n4) eventually 3 minutes later HA shows the ventilator running \\r\\n\\r\\nA question, what happens for other control points in the integration?  For example setting temperature setpoints, hvac modes, etc.   Are these reported faster? Are they set optimistically by the integration while waiting for an update? What\\'s the current convention?  Sometime when there are technical limitations (like poll times), the best we can do is have a consistent convention. \\r\\n a) exact\\r\\nb) exact \\r\\nc) exact (3 min is a mix of HA polling rate + very bad API from Ecobee) \\r\\nd) exact \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nother input for this integration)\\r\\n- numbers: After you change the value, it flips to the old value for few min (until an update) then you get the value you wanted. \\r\\n- Climate: as I look I found their workaround. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will try this: \\r\\n#L361C7-L364C49\\r\\n I just pushed a new commit that replicate the logic/behaviour of the climate platform and it works great (After this PR, I will make one to fix the number platform) \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you think > To make it consistent with the panel UI, we\\'d want a way to turn the 20mv on / off, display whether it is on or off and display the remaining time in minutes?\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make it consistent with the panel, I want the switch to be on for as long as the 20 min timer is on. This switch shows if the timer is on, not if the ventilator is on.  It\\'s a whole lot cleaner this way.  @joostlek - what do you think?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only functional item I\\'d like to see, to get the same functionality as the panel is how many minutes / seconds are remaining.  Consider adding an attribute to the switch that contains the remaining seconds or minutes?  I think this will be easier to use from a display than the time stamp which requires some conversion? Before doing that let\\'s see what @joostlek thinks about the current progress / direction.  >how many minutes / seconds are remaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is NOT available on the device. It only says `Ventilator (20 Min)` and the value does not change. It does not go 19-18-17-16 etc. It is just a static label. Caching the time zone delay will cause problems for a system that runs across a daylight savings time boundary.  We should calculate this when needed.   Not sure I follow you. The way I see this it will match whatever time the Ecobee is operating on. Since all the timestamps comes from the device It looks like you are calculating the time zone delay from UTC.  This delay changes when daylight savings time engages / disengages.  In New York time the offset right now is 4 hours.  But on 11/4 that becomes 5 hours. If I start HA on 11/2 it\\'ll record 4 hours in the __init__ for the entity.  Two days later that calculation would yield 5 hours but 4 is cached.  As a result the switch will reporting will be off until HA is restarted.   ooo, I see your point, I can move that calculation in every update. What do you think. \\r\\n\\r\\nI assumed it would be a lot of unnecessary recalculation. But you are right, this would get broken twice a year. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDo you think it\\'s worth moving in the `async_update` Based on our discussion I have proceed to move that logic in the update function',\n",

What error is it raising? We should catch that in the coordinator and raise `UpdateFailed`, which then renders the entities as unavailable A timeout error during the fetch. It does render the entities as unavailable in this case. oooh wait, I think I know what's happening. This is using the coordinator callback.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an entity turns unavailable, the callback is called, and then this guard is needed. If you would use the native_value property like below, it would just try to get the available property (which is implemented in the CoordinatorEntity, which sets the entity unavailable when the coordinator fails), and then proceeds to not request data from the native_value property. So tldr; I think we can use the code snippet below. But this is a code style question, since both are used in core, and the current setup is used in switchbot_cloud. I personally like the native_value property when there is little to no logic involved into setting values, but there is no preference.

       " 'Use `caplog` to very log behavior during tests I think this test can be omitted. I might think we prefer not to allow this yet and explicitly fail. If there are use cases that need this perhaps its a followup discussion? (Similarly, then registration can fail if the tool isn\\'t registered) Remove asserts (not a pattern used in production code). The rationale here is that for something like this if the specification is None its kind of undefined behavior so let it fail naturally (the caller had to do something really weird and it is a shouldn\\'t happen case. But also, i think it does something different in production code) I think `specification` should be its own `@dataclass` passed in during registration of the handler, then it gets functions like being converted to a dict or `__repr__`.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common pattern used for other registration is to separate the arguments needed for registration vs the arguments needed for the implementation of the handler. Have a look at [Services]( for example.\\r\\n\\r\\n(This allows the handler implementation to avoid inheritance and prefer composition)  I have changed the Tool.parameters to be a `voluptuous.Schema`, this matches what we have for the services. I don\\'t know how to dynamically create a `@dataclass`, but the `vol.Schema` should do the job. Can this be limited to the conversation domains or do we need to support arbitrary domains here in the `platform` field? I think right now the only expected value is literally `conversation`, but I can imagine that this field could be useful in the future. Please let me know if I should remove it or make a white list, etc Consider a scenario where one AI agent asks another AI agent to do something What is the text input if an LLM invokes the tool? would `text_input` be one of the intent tool args or not used? This is the user prompt. It is not really used, but intent handler expects it. I could use None, but then I thought there could be use cases in the future to have both user prompt and LLM arguments. Please let me know if I need to remove it. We talked on discord about potentially extracting an input class for a number of input arguments, similar to how conversation agent inputs or how intent inputs work.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that there can be different APIs for these two use cases if it helps:\\r\\n- how llm tools are called\\r\\n- how llm tool handlers accept inputs Done, please check The conversation agent integration that is calling the tools should take responsibility for:\\r\\n- exception handling: if the tool call fails (they catch `HomeAssistantError`)\\r\\n- json serialization\\r\\n- json deserialization\\r\\n\\r\\nSimilarly, the tool implementations are responsible for being well behaved and throwing exceptions (e.g. `HomeAssistantError`) on failure. Done Remove since this is not used, and having a default seems reasonable I\\'m not sure what is happening here with the pre processing and looking up areas and floors. Wouldn\\'t the intents themselves handle all of this? No, intents (the `DynamicServiceIntentHandler` specifically) expect area_id and floor_id. We are doing here a resolving of area_id and floor_id from its name or alias, replicating what is being done in `helpers.intent.async_match_states`. Consider using `_slot_schema` or exposing it as public so this doesn\\'t have to get into the specifics of specific intent handlers. I tried, but `_slot_schema` adds additional `{\"value\": validator}` layer that we don\\'t want.\\r\\nThis is a weird thing about intents, they have a slot_schema of, for example,\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what they actually expect is \\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes even `{\"value\": cv.string, \"text\": Any}`. Ok, I can use `_slot_schema` and remove the extra layer in the `IntentTool`. Done My impression is that tool agents expecting an openapi description of the tool would want to have a description of the response as well: #openapi\\r\\n\\r\\n(We could also consider responses as a second pass if that helps make incremental progress.)\\r\\n No, the Python API only uses input parameters:  Also LLMs are quite good at understanding structured json tool output in any format. I think we should tackle returning data in a follow up PR. I think the API needs some additional consideration. In the [architecture discussion]( the proposal was to tackle querying entities in follow up work. I agree that giving the LLM useful data about attributes is a good idea, though i am not sure yet that this should be a set of attributes defined in this file. It is not only for querying. Some intents return the list of states it affected and the list of states id could not.\\r\\nReturning `state.as_dict()` is too expensive in terms of input tokens, `state.name()` is too little information, so this was a compromise I\\'d come up with. I also don\\'t like the hardcoded list of \\'meaningful\\' attributes.\\r\\nI will remove them completely for now, and I agree, let\\'s leave it for a follow-up PR. I believe this is equivalent to:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHere and below you can pass the default argument to get to save some lines of code. When does this happen? I was considering this a \"shouldn\\'t happen\" case and the idea behind throwing the exception was not to silently repair it. Consider raising when tool name doesn\\'t exist. I believe the `slot_schema` case is always non-none except in tests? If so then i suggest removing the constructor and doing any other schema update work in the caller when creaeting the tool\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this does need to be optional, then I think its fine to just allow the schema to be `None` and handle this when validating the schema like how it works for the tool',\n",

I didn\\'t find a listener for config entry update that reloads the config entry. The PR empties the implementation of `async_setup_entry`, so a reload won\\'t do anything as I understand it. Ok. Why do we do a major version bump? Can\\'t we do a minor version bump instead, where we add `\"product\"` and `\"firmware\"` but keep `\"description\"`? I\\'ve implemented a minor version bump. If there\\'s a reason for the major bump, we can always do that later. Why is the implementation of `async_setup_entry` removed? The old implementation did two things:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. `check_multi_pan_addon` which essentially started the Multi-Protocol add-on whenever it was installed. This has some problems, like if multiple SkyConnects are used, or if the user migrated away while still having the Multi-Protocol add-on installed. As we recommend dedicated Thread firmware nowadays, Multi-Protocol is seen as self managed (the user should control the add-on, e.g. make sure it is configured to auto start etc.).\\r\\n2. The USB scan created a ZHA discovery for the Multi-Protocol add-on. For now, the user will have to manually configure the ZHA integration when using the Multi-Protocol add-on. The plan is to add a hassio discovery to make this process automatic again, so it will be quite easy again to install Multi-Protocol.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo essentially, for the current focus on Thread/Zigbee, these Multi-Protocol related things are no longer required. Since this class is only for installing SkyConnect firmware, maybe we should name it accordingly? This comment does not seem relevant, we bail out at the beginning of this method if the correct firmware is already installed? I don\\'t understand what this means. What does stalling addon startup have to do with detecting what firmware is on the device? By design, add-ons which are used by Core have the startup type `service`. This means the Supervisor starts them before Core. And conversely, this means the add-on might already use this particular radio, and we should not talk to it as it would interfere the add-on\\'s operations!\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, we don\\'t have a global serial port management (yet), so we have to query the usual suspects manually here. OK, I see, that explanation is clearer. Can you make a suggestion which makes the comment equally clear? This seems non deterministic since the zha config entry may or may not be loaded when this function is called. Could we make `zha` an after_dependency of this integration? Or check if the config entry is enabled instead of if it\\'s loaded? Why do we not just jump straight into the `pick_firmware` step? Why do users need to confirm first?  I don\\'t think that we should confuse the user with words like \"border router\" and \"coordinator\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe something like\\r\\n\\r\\n- Use for Zigbee\\r\\n- Use for Thread (this includes Matter over Thread) Why would we tell the user this specific?

Hi @sdb9696 tanks for the review!\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat, I removed the separate device registry and defined a base entity to use in sensors and later in binary sensors entitites. A side effect of this change I made is that when reloading an integration, if there's any field of the device data that changed, like the firmware version, then that's not longer updated in the device page. I will research how to fix this. Did you get anywhere with this? The device info on the entity should be read when the config entry is loaded. Done, now the data is updated properly, thanks!

Yes that's better. I removed the exceptions module and defined the exceptions where they're used. Regarding the `MQTTNotEnabled` error, you're right, there are other errors that may break the MQTT communication, like the broker being down, so I created a more generic` MQTTEerror` to show. I think this is only used by the device registration so should be defined where that happens, i.e. `entity.py` or `__init__.py` Yes, I moved those constants to the `entity.py` module. Do you need this wrapper or could you just create the library class directly elsewhere? No, it's not required. I simplified this by directly instantiating the library class where it's used.

If it's unavailable we can probably bail out early? Checking at the rest of group implementations there is no early return in case the entity is marked as unavailable.

On this one and remaining below. Should we really return the most common one instead of having a sort off priority of states?\\r\\nExample: One is heating and two are off. Should we then not return `heat` instead of `off`? HVAC modes used as state of a climate entity can be seen as an binary state with multiple ON states. Here the logic is filtering out the negative stats (OFF, UNAVAILABLE) so if any entity state is active (or ON state) those values are taken into account. Then similarly on how some enums attributes are being aggregated across entities in other groups, taking the most common enum value has been the consensus at the moment. Ok. So perhaps I took a bad example so let's do another one.\\r\\n3 entities, one is `heat` and two are `fan_only`. With your logic the group state would be `fan_only`.\\r\\nIs that really what is wished here instead of returning `heat`?\\r\\n\\r\\nBtw: Don't resolve until we agree, it's annoying to have to unresolve to continue the discussion  > 3 entities, one is heat and two are fan_only. With your logic the group state would be fan_only.\\r\\nIs that really what is wished here instead of returning heat?\\r\\n\\r\\nYes that was my intention since the beginning. I think the logic behind of why `heat` might be more important than `fan_only` could be driven that could be a more costly mode. This issue was raised on the discussion of the original  docs PR: #discussion_r973765098\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, I believe that most common mode might be the fairest approach as ranking can be really hard to do. `heat` might be ranked higher than `cool` or `fan_only` on colder countries, while it could be the other way around on much more hot countries. This can be a matter of perspective depending on how costly each mode is on different climate environments, therefore having a more uniform approach looks the right solution to me by taking the most common mode across all working modes (excluding `off`).\\r\\n \\r\\nI suppose something like this should do? (and the `merge_modes` function is not needed?) Note that `find_state_attributes` would return a list (one entry for each state) of lists (with all the modes). The suggested changed would yield a list of lists (note that lists are hashable and can be used inside a set). For that reason the logic `list(set().union(*modes))` is used. Wrapped it in a simple method for readability purposes given that it is also being used multiple times. Right, my point was more that this needs to be able to be set as an empty list.\\r\\nNow if nothing comes back it will just skip it and `swing_modes` will be the previous list. Done I wonder a bit about this one as we can send temp-range to entities which doesn't support it.\\r\\nShould we not be more explicit about only sending what is actually supported? Given that we are at the end calling the same method/service for all entities with all data (target value and range), each entity implementation would consume the values it needs ([example](#L703-L707)), we can have here a simple logic that would call the same service with all the available data to all the entities in the group I don't think you entirely understand my point.\\r\\nLooking at `sensibo` as example it doesn't support `target_range` and therefore it would raise if you call it with range values, see #L321\\r\\n\\r\\nI don't think that's very user friendly Agreed that would not be very user friendly, but I would argue that here we are talking about a more fundamental API problem. Having a method that contains a freeform of arguments being passed (through the `**kwargs`) without any guarantees about which parameters are being passed independently of the supported features of each entity type, leads to individual implementations handling their optionality in different ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith some [search]( you can see that there are different implementations handling the presence and missing of parameters in different ways:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. If not getting the value you need, do nothing: [code](#L395)\\r\\n2. Silently raising a `KeyError` exception: [examples](\\r\\n3. Pass the target temperature value or `None` down the line to the underlying coordinator: [code](#L86)\\r\\n4. And others around how to handle the temperature range I did not went too far to dig in....\\r\\n\\r\\nThe point you just raise about the exception being raised would have also happened if we were to make a service call to a list of entity types and providing all parameters in the schema (at the end a group is doing that when its service is being called).  If we call a `sensibo` device with an `ecobee` with all parameters in the schema, we would get the methods called, but because [of this line](#L996) we would not be calling the methods to update the state in the state machine, which again is not very user friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy point (and preference) here is that in an ideal world, logic should be simple everywhere rather than complex. Specific climate platforms should not raise Exceptions if not supported parameters are being passed, as well as the group should just forward whatever parameters have been given to all the entities in the group (more future proof in case the schema of the call gets extended).\\r\\n\\r\\nI can update the logic and make it more complex to take into account the supported features for each entity in the group so we make a targeted call for each entity, but this would not solve the bigger underlying problem that set temperature in a Climate entity ID already has and this change is not enlarging.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me know if I should proceed with updating the logic.

I think that it is not required to initialize the `self._attr_swing_modes ` and ` self._attr_swing_mode = None` in that phase, because at that time, swing support in not available, so the only thing to initialize is the register.  STATE_UNKNOWN is used later, so either None or STATE_UNKNOWN is not correct. Yes STATE_UNKNOWN is used later, but it is reasonable to think that STATE_UNKNOWN is correct also at that time, I suppose, because at that time the component doesn\\'t know its status yet...\\r\\nAnother way could be add STATE_UNAVAILABLE later, but only in case the pymodbus answers with a negative value, else it should be unknown..

I was curious if we should just increase the default. I saw this before at 7 and thought that it was pretty low. Not sure if it would solve your problem to increase the default and not offer this as an option.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe default for YAML config is [1 day](#L70) and changeable by the user on demand.\\r\\nWhen configuring via UI, than we actually set 7 days which might be enough for many (_most_) of the users, but sometimes it is to less (_see #108003_).\\r\\nSo i thought to make it configurable again, would offer the most flexibility to the users.\\r\\nMy own use case is my birthdays calendar - i don\\'t have much friends, therefor not much entries in there 🙈😁 so it happens that next date will be a few more days/weeks far Would there be a down side if we just set the default to 30 days? or 60 days? yeah, i think it might still not be enough for some users. tbh the link issue is the only one i know complaining about it, so i think the 7 days is already ok for most users. Maybe we should just mention the 7 days and the possibility to change it in the docs? one downside of statically increasing to 60 or 90 days, it might result in higher load on CalDAV servers, especial on well filled calendars 🤔  If we can find a default that works for most folks (e.g. 14 days, 30 days) that seems like it be ideal to not need extra configuration options. please don\\'t get me wrong, but why not give the user the possibility to change this on it\\'s own preferences or needs?\\r\\nSure, we can also increase the default to 30 which might be also good for most users, but also might increase the load on their caldav servers (_since more events might be returned_) and and their HA instances (_since more events needs to be checked which is the very next one_).\\r\\nFurther i think most users are already satisfied with the 7 days, since we we got only the one issue till now. My general impression is we want to not offer additional configuration options unless needed, and not necessarily support use cases that are far outside the norm. If we can find a balance of end user simplicity and performance then that would be ideal. If its not possible to find that middle ground because its too expensive, then its not possible i guess.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Perhaps bad idea: could also be adaptive (first try 7 days, then 14, then max 32 if no events are found).) @allenporter: I am the one who opened #108003 and I certainly would not call said garbage reminder once a month \"far outside the norm\". In fact, I initially was happy with the HA update that made the CalDAV integration available via GUI only to spend days wondering why my calendar did not work until I found out about this limitation of days which was nowhere documented.\\r\\nBesides: just because I\\'m the only one who opened a bug report does not mean numerous others also fell for this limitation and silently just gave up and reverted to the manual YAML way. If you read my above responses I\\'m not against solving this use case.  I just don\\'t want to add more configuration options. Instead you\\'d be surprised it didn\\'t work and have to hunt down a config option you didn\\'t know existed. We should just make it work for you out or the box with no additional action on your part.\\n\\nI\\'m in favor of solving this in a few ways proposed above... either increasing the limit (is this really an efficiency problem? I\\'m skeptical) or doing something adaptive and more efficient. \\n\\nHappy to be overruled here by other code approvers, that\\'s just my 2 cents. The logical solution would be the one initially supposed by @mib1185: an options dialogue letting the user decide how many days to check, maybe with a note that too many days might increase the server load (which of course depends on the infrastructure, overall number of calendars and individual entries to check and such). To top it: a separate days chooser for each calendar, maybe as simple as entities after the initial setup.\\r\\nAnyway, it should be emphasized in the docs that only one single day is taken into account. Currently, it is only mentioned in the [manual configuration steps]( and very easily overlooked, especially if someone uses the GUI integration and thus will most likely never get the idea to check these manual steps. At least that is what I did or better did not before I opened what I believed to be a bug report.\\r\\nI will happily update the current docs accordingly, but it seems more efficient to wait for the outcome of this proposed change to avoid the need to update the docs again shortly afterwards. :wink:  I\\'m still on the point, that having this option does not overwhelm our users, because it is not part of the integration setup phase (_config flow_), but can later be changed by the user if needed (_options flow_).\\r\\nAlso, as mentioned before, I think the default setting of 7 days is suitable for most of our users, so only a few users will need this option and then have it. Last but not least we could describe the options in the docs (_eq. we do in [AVM Fritz!Tools](#integration-options)_) - i\\'m happy to update the docs accordingly 🙂 \\r\\n',\n",

I see in your other comment that we said the same thing. revert same same may be sensitive to value = None, consider turnery \\r\\n\\r\\n @EvanSchalton Mentioned above, but `convert_temperature_if_needed` does handle `None` so this should be fine.

I think I asked before on the last PR, why did we do this again?

The coordinator data for the `status_key` is one of the allowed values in `status_sensor_exists_values`\\r\\n\\r\\nThe reason for the slightly clunky logic with the `status_sensor_exists_values` is that the thermostat returns a value for the status for which multiple may correspond to the sensor being available. For instance, the Indoor temperature controlling sensor should show in the UI if the `INDOOR_TEMPERATURE_CONTROLLING_SENSOR_STATUS` value is either 0 (normal) or 1/2 (installed but in an error state). What do you think about maybe splitting the classes into the different sensors you are providing here? Even tho this works, you have a shared entity (And entity description) that doesn\\'t have that much overlap.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the controlling sensors `status_sensor_available_value`, `status_sensor_exists_values` and `value_fn` are all the same, while for the status ones, `status_sensor_available_value` are all the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso since the `available` property is based around the difference in both sensors, would it make sense to maybe split the `AprilaireSensor` into 2 classes? (You could add a third to have 1 class inheriting both `BaseAprilaireEntity, SensorEntity` and then have the two other classes inherit this superclass). I think this way, the code is more clearer on what it does and when it does something and is easier for extending in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut let me know what you think (don\\'t see this as a must, just throwing an idea) @joostlek Personally I think that would introduce more complexity than it\\'s worth and it would reduce the flexibility, especially considering future uses that are possible. In terms of the cases where the values are the same, the `value_fn` won\\'t be the same once we reintroduce the temperature conversion that I removed. Also, if this were to be extended to have more of the sensors supported, then the `status_sensor_available_value` and `status_sensor_exists_values` wouldn\\'t be the same, requiring refactoring at that point.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m _open_ to changing it up, but I don\\'t see a great way of doing it that wouldn\\'t just add a lot of bloat for no real benefit. But keep in mind you can then introduce the conversion in the abstraction for example. So you put the unit conversion in the `native_value` function of that sensor.\\n\\nDo you already know what you want to add in future sensors? Maybe I can give it a shot.\\n\\n(Feel free to message me on discord if you want to have some chats about it) @joostlek I have made some changes, I think it addresses what you\\'re thinking. Let me know if you\\'re meaning anything else. A \"controlling\" sensor sounds strange, what does it reflect? The setpoint?\\n\\nThe name indicates that it\\'s configurable, but it isn\\'t, otherwise it\\'d be a number entity The \"controlling\" sensor is what the sensor is called on the Aprilaire side. I believe it is named that way because it is what is \"controlling\" the behavior of the thermostat, as opposed to auxiliary sensors which are only informational. In this integration, only the \"controlling\" sensors are supported. Would you mind rechecking the naming? Maybe the info \"In this integration, only the \"controlling\" sensors are supported\" would be good to add to the docs and then the sensor naming can be more simplistic.\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause otherwise we have an entity name like `sensor.device_indoor_temperature_controlling_sensor` and that looks strange @joostlek Did you mean adding that to the home-assistant.io documentation? Or were you referring to adding a clarifying comment to the code? To the integration docs yes  Move this up to before the entity classes, and add `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of the module so the type checker allows forward references. make `BaseAprilaireSensor.exists` a class method so we don\\'t instantiate objects only to immediately discard them Instead of the cast here, we can declare the type of the status maps as `dict[StateType, str]` to show that we intend to index them with any `StateType` Why do we have this check? There\\'s no subclass which doesn\\'t set `self.status_sensor_exists_values`\\r\\nSame comment for the availability method I will remove. For `available` there is in fact a subclass (`AprilaireStatusSensor`) where `status_sensor_available_value` is `None` (because it is always available if it exists), so I am leaving that one. Instead of the cast, can we annotate `AprilaireCoordinator.data` to be a `dict[str, str | int | float]`? Shouldn\\'t this case be first? Or should the fan status sensor, which is the only sensor which doesn\\'t have a status_key, never be unavailable? @emontnemery Yes that is correct. The fan status sensor is always available.

So the device sends the measurements each 10 seconds, if there is any restriction about scan interval, I could change it  Currently you are polling the device every 10 seconds. If the device _sends_ the data you should move to a push style approach (but that could also be done later as an improvement). ~~I\\'m not aware about any limits~~, Limit is 5 seconds, but 10 seconds is still quite often and you are putting load on the system of your users. The question is, if there is really a benefit in doing that, or, if the data doesn\\'t change that much, wouldn\\'t less frequent polls be enough. Also, since you say it\\'s a `cloud_polling` integration your also putting load on the vendor\\'s system It works so that the device sends the data to our web platform and the integration gets the data from this platform, not directly from the device. In that case should I define the type of integration as `cloud_push` or stick with `cloud_polling` ? ah understood. In that case stick with `cloud_poll` I suggest you move to a `DataUpdateCoordinator`. That way you can get an update for all entities at once (since they all appear to be using the same endpoint), and don\\'t need to do updates per entity. Thank you very much for your suggestion, does it mean that I will need to get rid of the Entity descriptions, or only from value_fn field in this descriptions in sensor.py ? no, it has nothing to do with that. You\\'d basically add a separate file `coordinator.py` and move the update logic from both the sensor and here to there. Here\\'s the offiicial documentation: #coordinated-single-api-poll-for-data-for-all-entities and here\\'s an example for a simple implementation  Thanks for the information Hi, I\\'m trying to implement `DataUpdateCoordinator` as you suggested, but to be honest I\\'m having difficulties with it. I looked into the documentation that you provided as well as into simple example. I\\'ve also found a couple of other examples. In those examples it seems that the Python client takes no place in entities generation, however I would like to have both of the coordinator and Python client in this process. The reason why I would like to do it is because Python client has some attributes that need to be passed into the entities and device itself. And here comes the problem that there is some kind of conflict between the coordinator and Python client.

       " \"There's already a pressure sensor reporting in bar, is this the same data, just with a different unit? Yes, I made it this way so that the specific equipment pressure sensor will display the value with same unit as in the myUplink App. Just to double confirm, we create multiple sensors in Home Assistant for the same data but with different units? Or will the backing hardware EITHER have a pressure sensor reading in Pa OR a presure sensor in bar?\\r\\n\\r\\nSame question for the duration sensors. Nope, the API exposes 20-100 datapoints (=sensors) for a typical heatpump. The API will for most sensors send metadata describing the type of data (=device_class) and unit (=native_unit_of_measurement) in addition to the actual value There can be many different pressure measurements. Some pressure sensors measure internal pressures value across e.g. a fan and some could represent athmospheric pressure or water pressure in floor heating systems. So the entity_description will assign an optimal set of arguments for the specific measurement type.\\r\\n\\r\\nSame applies to duration measurements. Some sensors will tell you how many seconds the compressor has been running in the last cycle. Another sensor can display for how many days the compressor has been running the last year.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it is reasonable to use the units that the API suggests as defaults in HA. OK, and the user can differentiate between, for example multiple pressure sensors, because the name of the entity is set to `device_point.parameter_name` which is descriptive enough to make sense? Exactly. These are the auto-generated sensor names for my Nibe F730 heatpump.\\r\\n![image](\\r\\n There are already multi sensors reporting time, are the ones added in this PR the same, just with different units? Same reason as above. This is to keep the default unit the same as in myUplink app for each datapoint. The API can expose many different points of duration data, in some of them seconds is the relevant unit in others days are relevant. I think it will be a better user experience if we stick to the defaults that the API suggests in the metadata.\",\n",

It\\'s an interesting idea to let the user add multiple devices at once, but I am not sure how often it will happen that someone adds multiple USB Power-Sockets at the same time.

What if some BLEDevice becomes available shortly after async_setup_entry is called? Then it will only become available once HA restarts again. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou can also register a callback with HA in your async_setup_entry that will update the ble_device for your dice. This is useful if your device becomes available through a different adapter or bluetooth proxy:\\r\\n initially I used `assert not None` to fix type check failure - `async_ble_device_from_address` returns BLEDevice | None, while `BleakClient` first arg is BLEDevice|str. But yes I agree that in case `ble_device` is None then AssertionError will be raised and HA will skip connection retry. I\\'ve put that code snipped under try-catch too to make sure I wrap an exception with `ConfigEntryNotReady` if any If you ever get a type check failure you can also use TYPE_CHECKING constant which will only execute the assertion for type checkers:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in this case I think the best way to solve it is indeed to use `ConfigEntryNotReady`, then HA will automatically retry it later. I would still add the `async_register_callback()` though to always have access to the latest BLEDevice does not `async_ble_device_from_address` return the latest ble_device ? I supposed it does. Theoretically I can register a callback to receive the last ble_device too after a call to `async_ble_device_from_address` but I\\'m not sure I need it anywhere now. I try to connect once when the integration loads, then if it fails I just raise `ConfigEntryNotReady` leverage HA reconnect. In case of receiving new `ble_device` while integration is alive I will just lose it after initiating integration reload since as I understand all vars are lost between reloads.\\r\\nPlease correct me if I\\'m wrong Do you only connect once when the integration loads and not anymore after that? In that case I don\\'t think you need the latest BLEDevice, but if the user can initiate a connection themselves then you should use the latest BLEDevice for that as it contains information on what adapter it is available on Correct, I connect once only when the integration loads I would personally put these keys in const.py not sure it is needed since they are not referenced anywhere else Try to add types for the arguments and return type.

Why don\\'t you put it in BaseSensor? Then you can also remove the __init__ for each of these right?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd you can include the descriptions like below. Also small point but you write `async_add_entities(entries)` but you are really adding entities instead of entries, but that won\\'t be a problem if you do it like this.\\r\\n good catch, really better to adjust a base constructor to be used for all child classes. Done I would suggest just writing names out fully when they are not too long. Makes it much easier to understand what the function does when quickly reading through it. Same goes for a couple of other cases like using \\'desc\\' for \\'description\\', or \\'devinfo\\' for \\'device_info\\' which you already addressed. Difference in length is not too much but something like device_info or _handle_number_update is much clearer as opposed to devinfo or _handle_upd\\r\\n Why do you use a separate function `create_device_info` if that function is only really used once? Also, I think you can remove sw_version if it will never be known, and if it will change later you can set it to `None` instead of `\"unknown\"`\\r\\n\\r\\nActually I don\\'t think you even need to save the DeviceInfo in hass.data right?

Agreed! I usually leave the unique id in the constructor of the platform entities. Each entity requires a unique id, so I don\\'t see an advantage in doing this. Please call it entity.py This should happen in sensor.py This will hard code names. We should use translation keys. Even tho every sensor would only need 2 fields (or 3 if you add the value function as well), I recommend looking at entity descriptions for this. Can you explain how media player entities are created at the moment? I understood that we create one per zone, is that correct? Yes, one per zone. After the change we will have 11 per zone. The zone attribute is that you are able to see which sensor entity belongs to which media player (main) entity. But you can already see to which receiver it belongs, so how much added value do these extra state attributes add?\\n\\nFyi, we\\'re more hesitant to add new extra attributes, because they usually can be extra sensors or are unneeded, but still take a lot of space in the database. Tbh., I would have problems to see the relationship between the media player entity and the sensor entities without the `Zone` attribute.\\r\\nI can assume that there is a relationship based on the suffixes of the entity names (no suffix, `_2`, `_3`), but this relationship is gone when I start renaming the entities. That\\'s why I added this property.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I checked the properties and all the sensors belong to properties which are device settings and not zonal settings. Thus, we don\\'t need to create them multiple time and will have 10 sensor entities + one media player entity per zone only.  Is every media player its own device?\\n\\nDon\\'t I then have a device called \"living room\" and \"bedroom\"? Nope, a device represents a physical receiver which can have up to 3 zones. Each zone is represented by a media player.\\r\\nIt is easy to figure out a relationship between a device and its entities, but it is hard to figure out relationships between different entities of the same device. As I said before, you could assume a relationship depending on the names, but this lasts only until you start renaming entities.\\r\\nAnyway, the relationship between entities is a theoretical discussion now, because there is only one sensor entity per device left. I am more talking about the relationship between devices and the sensor entities. If the device is called \"Bedroom\" and you attach these entities, it would prepend the devicename, avoiding the `_1` and `_2`. It would look like `sensor.bedroom_something`. This would also rename when you rename the device, it will ask you if you also want to rename the entities attached to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut looking at the sensor setup code, you only setup the sensors for one entry and not per zone. > But looking at the sensor setup code, you only setup the sensors for one entry and not per zone.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, that\\'s what I said in my second message and did with \\r\\n\\r\\n> However, I checked the properties and all the sensors belong to properties which are device settings and not zonal settings.

There was no reason to change this in the first place afaict.

Can you maybe give an example why the special rounding is needed? The device does always return celsius. The problem is when converting to Fahrenheit, the device itself uses away-from-zero midpoint rounding, whereas Python uses banker's rounding. This leads to inconsistent rounding in the case of values when the user is displaying values in Fahrenheit in HA.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider 22.5C which is 72.5F. With away-from-zero rounding, the device displays this as 73F. However with banker's rounding, HA would show this as 72F.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution as implemented is to have the sensor always report that it has the same native unit of measurement as it is configured to display in, and then handle the correct rounding when returning the native value. This actually reminds me that I need to do the same for the climate entity.

So i think i can remove the attribution.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, is there is a way to query the api once on integration start and then every day at 14:00 + some random delay as the data only changes at 14:00 ? and how would this be implemented ?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother question regarding entity-id's: mine look this: \\r\\n\\r\\n`sensor.energy_market_price_current_hour`\\r\\n\\r\\nwhereas easyenergy's integration entity is: \\r\\n\\r\\n`sensor.easyenergy_today_energy_usage_current_hour`\\r\\n\\r\\nShouldn't they be unique (to have all energy providers providing the same entity-ids, but then you cannot have more than one energy provider) ? \\r\\n\\r\\nOr should i add `awattar_` to the entity-id to distinguish them so that every integration providing energy data has different - and unique entity-id's ?\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the other points (except testing) i already solved thanks to your suggestions :) Why not set as default in the dataclass above?

Ok got it thanks! \\r\\nI\\'ll update this. Done, most of the code specific to the uptime sensor has been moved to the `DataUpdateCoordinator` Why would this be needed? The coordinator only updates once a minute. The glances API provides a string representing a timespan (like  \"uptime\": \"3 days, 10:25:20\") but does not provide the absolute time it refers to. There is a sum of delays which varies each time the API is called (internal Glances poll loop, duration of the Api call, time inside Home assistant before converting back to an absolute time..) which means that the resulting datetime computed in the HA sensor varies from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the configuration, for each call of the API.\\r\\nIt\\'s not a big deal for an uptime sensor as it is typically measured in days or weeks rather than seconds or minutes.\\r\\nBut without this check to eliminate small changes, the sensor value changes every minute which makes the history UI unreadable and spams the database uselessly. I have moved the update frequency code to the `DataUpdateCoordinator` This does not give an uptime. It gives you the time it started.\\r\\nShould the sensor be named differently? This seems to be the standard in home assistant : uptime sensors return a datetime which is the moment of startup. \\r\\nSee for example the uptime integration : \\r\\n#L34\\r\\nA few other examples:\\r\\n#L111\\r\\n#L143\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the UI, the absolute datetime is displayed as a relative time (like 2 days 10 hours..) by default, so I think it makes sense.\\r\\n How about just checking here if it should refresh. Something like:\\r\\n The test is a bit more complex, because we don\\'t just wait for a certain time to refresh. We need to check if the uptime itself has changed significantly, and update it only of it has moved more than a certain amount.\\r\\nHence the comparison to the previous uptime value, not to the previous refresh time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we want to avoid is a succession of changes to uptime like this (what i called flapping) - those are actual values for a server that was not restarted:\\r\\n uptime=2024-03-10 21:**18**:28.**588024**+00:00\\r\\n uptime=2024-03-10 21:**19**:28.**397835**+00:00\\r\\n uptime=2024-03-10 21:**20**:28.**381627**+00:00\\r\\n uptime=2024-03-10 21:**18**:28.**408223**+00:00\\r\\n uptime=2024-03-10 21:**19**:28.**393393**+00:00\\r\\n uptime=2024-03-10 21:**20**:28.**391400**+00:00\\r\\n uptime=2024-03-10 21:**18**:28.**410554**+00:00\\r\\n uptime=2024-03-10 21:**19**:28.**382378**+00:00\\r\\n \\r\\nJust overwrite the value?

Check Flexit_bacnet (I think the number entities) for an example I was thinking `ValloxButtonEntityDescription` will be stored somewhere, so it would be bad to extend it with non serializable data. Will take a look. Nope. Some integrations contain 10s entities. To avoid creating 50 separate classes, we have this entity description that we can inject from which it takes data. This way we can keep all the logic of that sensor concentrated in one place. I do not think this integration would ever have more than one DateEntity.

Although this works, this isn't the optimal way of using either method I see DateEntity class has entity_description: DateEntityDescription parameter. No idea what it is used for.

True, a DateEntity would be a bit more flexible. 🤔 I liked the simplicity of the button though.

The EntityDescription classes are immutable and that makes it more complex to change or add attributes. We pick up static data from get_description and then add other more dynamic attributes by setting \\\\_attr\\\\_*  this way. We should not add entities without an entity description. Can this even happen? Yes, it can happen. In fact it is common in sensor platform. The API delivers some 60 device points for e.g a Nibe F730. It is not uncommon that we can't identify the optimal device description from the meta-data. Then we create the entity without description.

But the names are not stable enough so we have chosen not to use names for selecting platform or device_class.\\r\\nIf a device_point has the attributes maxValue and minValue set and writable is true it is best represented in HA by a number entity even if we cannot assign an optimal device_class or icon.

At least that's what I thought was happening.

And then we only put all the extra sensor info on the children so they can drill in. Is this `children_coordinators` logic specific to `Iot` Strips?  I think so as the `Smart` parent handles the updates for it's children.  If that's so then this should probably check for `Iot.Strip` to be specific Also I can't work out why this doesn't also use the ` _entities_for_device_and_its_children` I think we should be naming all our entities with the TPLink prefix.

Leaving less legacy. But that would trigger sudden state changes of this sensor even if the source doesn\\'t change (which is also the point of this PR).  We should always avoid breaking changes I can leave it as is, then current users will get a `None` value for `max_dt` and not get time based integration.  I would advise the use of a more sensible max: 1hour ? 1 day ? For most users 1 hour or 1 day is probably more than a sufficient max. However, \\r\\n- I can imagine users with slow updating source sensors wanting the flexibility of waiting on a state change for longer periods, e.g. days, weeks, months. \\r\\n- Setting this value very high is effectively disabling time based integration triggers. Which is can be useful with the number selector in the webinterface not accepting `None`. See also my other comment about this. As per my comment on the main thread, I suggest the use of zero to disable max_dt Good suggestion! Done. I did not convert it to None in the config flow, but it the constructor of the sensor. Will see how it can be done in the config flow.  What did you mean with \"You can use zero as a special value that is converted to None in the config_flow\"? I guess my current approach overriding it in the constructor of the sensor is not what you meant? \\r\\n\\r\\nHow would I convert 0 to None in the `config_flow`?

Did the conversion of `0` to `None` in the `async_setup_entry`, looks like the right place. availability should be set when the sensor is added and should follow the source, why remove ? This has been moved to line 446 and it is (like with the current implementation) set after it passes some validations checks on the source. it\\'s in `_integrate_on_state_change` but this method is not called by `async_added_to_hass` Correct. But in the old situation it was part of the method\\r\\n\\r\\nwhich was defined in the scope of the method `async_added_to_hass`. But it was only executed as part of state changes. you are right, should probably fix this is another PR 😓  Good to know! Availability was and is now set only if the source sends an update. We can address this method afterwards. There is also a legacy comment in the `async_added_to_hass`. I expect this PR makes it easier to address because of the extraction of the calculation logic. We should not create a breaking change This might be an issue, as the state might be written twice ( _derive_and_set_attributes_from_state plus this function) I\\'ve removed the write state call from `_derive_and_set_attributes_from_state`. Then now it will only be called once: on unavailability of the source or successful integration.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote however that this call was also made twice during the state change `calc_integration` method.  Should we skip calling this if the state is `0`? I use riemann a lot for sensors that spend a lot of time at 0, and it would be nice to have high frequency updates when the sensor is nonzero, but seems just wasted cycles to keep calling this when it is not accumulating.  Sounds like a nice optimization! Will give it a try. Don\\'t over optimize... this integration is doing simple math, it takes no time. \\r\\n\\r\\nGo for it, but don\\'t overcomplicate the code ;) While the individual operations are probably minor simple math, I wasn\\'t sure if having dozens of riemann\\'s doing updates frequently forever would put extra load on the system or reduce power optimization if it has to keep waking up all the time to service and reschedule timers. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I\\'m not a core expert, so feel free to ignore the suggestion if it doesn\\'t make sense. \\r\\n\\r\\nJust thinking about my own use case, I have 20 sprinkler zones which are off/`0` 99% of the time, but use riemann to accumulate water consumption when they are on. It would be cool if they could update consumption in relatively quick realtime when they are on (once/minute?), but didn\\'t want to have them all calling callback timers infinitely forever.  You should not worry about it :) specially because max_dt will work seconds (not milliseconds) Yes keep it simple. Now I use helper template sensors with time triggers to force updates. This will be more efficient I guess.\\nThanks for fixing this 🙏 On second thought this cannot be skipped when the source is 0. We still want to update `_last_integration_time` and `_last_integration_trigger` even if the source is constant 0. This doesn\\'t affect the integral, but it will affect future calculations if your source starts increasing again after a period of constant 0. \\r\\n\\r\\nDid apply the following other minor optimizations:\\r\\n- Using the new state for scheduling a trigger and not accessing the source sensor from hass. Because if the timer didn\\'t cancel, the state wasn\\'t changed, so the earlier obtained new_state from the `EventStateChangedData` can be used. This is more clean and in line with the source being constant assumption.\\r\\n- Only schedule a trigger if the new_state is numeric.  Why do we have this nonsensical max value, does it not work if it\\'s omitted? The statistics sensor already has a [max_age configuration parameter](#max_age) which means something completely different (discard old samples) compared to what it means here (fall back to sampling if the source sensor does not update for some time)\\r\\n\\r\\nCan we try to give a better name for this parameter?

Is it heating the air inside the hvac unit or is it pre-heating the air before it is blown into my bedroom?

When there are more than one switch the user can enable more than one Switch. That\\'s not possible with a Select.\\r\\nSee the Plugwise climate thermostat_schedule select for reference:\\r\\n![image](\\r\\n Looking at the backend code, and at a relevant Husqvarna webpage, my impression is that there is only one Schedule so implementing a single Switch would be OK. Yes, if there is more than one schedule and only one schedule can be active at the same time, a select entity is better than a switch. @Thomas55555 Does the lawnmower App provide a single schedule/calendar?

If we change the \"49994\" key to \"NIBEF F730 CU 3x400V-49994\" it will be correct for F730 and the sensor will show a number value with default icon for all other devices with a \"49994\". \\r\\nI am currently working on a better method to interpret the point metadata and assign proper platform, device_class and other properties. Hopefully this will be reasonably correct. The ambition should be that the need for \"manual\" overrides is not too big.\\r\\nThe overall aim with the intergration is to make use of the metadata and do the best we can with it. The alternative is to maintain a huge database from all manufacturers connected to myUplink and all their models and that seems rather unattractive to me. Here is a output for my S320 - seems like the parameter_id\\'s is unique.\\r\\n\\r\\n Could we calculate the prefix by only using the `device_point.category`? Eg by looking for a separator in the string or taking a certain number of characters from the beginning etc?\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'d like to avoid having a tuple of known prefixes to match against and needing to maintain that tuple. This is a difficult one...\\r\\nThere is no simple way to categorize the models. The product,name appears on different levels in the object hierarchy and the device_point.category is not an exact match to the product.name.\\r\\nMy interpretation of the data model in the API:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. An account can containg many systems.\\r\\n2. A system is a heat-pump appliance.\\r\\n3. A system can contain one or more devices\\r\\n4. A device contains many device-point.\\r\\n5. There is no official documentation from the manufacturer on the actual data that each model reports.\\r\\n\\r\\nExample from my F730:\\r\\nOne system with one device with some 45 device points.\\r\\nproduct.name in system object: \"F730 CU 3x400V\"\\r\\na single device with product.name: \"F730 CU 3x400V\"\\r\\ncategory in all device_points: \"NIBEF F730 CU 3x400V\"\\r\\n\\r\\nExample from @pajzo:\\r\\nproduct.name: unknown to me\\r\\ncategory in device_points: Mostly \"NIBE VVM S320 E EM 3x400V DK\" but mixed with \"Varmepumpe 1\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI am out of ideas (for a short moment - I hope). I am a bit sorry that the search for a perfect solution is blocking other areas of improvements. It is possible to create generic binary_sensors, generic switches and other suitable entities. It is when it comes to fine-tuning device_classes, icons, display precision etc that we are stuck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current solution will work for Fxxx -series appliances. All other models will show up with generic sensors as in the original release.\\r\\nI suggest that we merge this version. We can then revisit the challenge of classifying appliance models when we have collected more diagnostic data. I agree with you @astrandb, i think it\\'s fine to map based on parameter_id, and fallback on paramter_unit. Then we over time can improve by adding more and more parameter_id mappings. We now have confirmation thay S series have a different numbering scheme which may overlap. So we must discern them.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also now see that S series prefix by \"NIBE\" and F series by \"NIBEF\". That is enough.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust use partition on the category and grab first words. Use a double level dict. For lookup.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso avoid putting unit lookups and paramater id lookups in same dict.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n Thank you @elupus for you constructive ideas. They are implemented now. Please wait with adding this until it\\'s populated. OK What does this check mean? Normally the API will not include device_point that are permanently unavailable. The API will return -32768 if data is temporarily unavailable. I.e. \"Unknown\" with HA terminolgy. It happens on two data_points in my F730. I think it is better to show \"Unknown\" than showing -32768.',\n",

Disregard, I didn't realize `mac_code` is just 4 characters and not the complete mac address. I think you can simplify this by using `bluetooth.async_ble_device_from_address`. Disregard, I didn't notice you where selecting the device by name and not by mac address. These icons should be defined in `icons.json`. Will add them there thanks! This probably does not matter, but this could also be done when the config entry is setup and the bluetooth device is first discovered. That way you wouldn't have to search the device again using `async_ble_device_from_address`. The `MotionDevice` instance could then be stored in `hass.data`. Initially I didn't know how to pass data from config flow to an entity, but I could have indeed used this. However, right now I use `hass.data` to save the cover entity, which is then used by the other platforms to register callbacks. `hass.data[DOMAIN][entry.entry_id] = blind` Sure, I think it's fine either way. If you should change your mind about using `hass.data` you could of course always assign a dictionary to store multiple different objects. These methods seem to be unused and the callbacks are never set.

       " \"Some code from mixins is no also used in discovery.py.\\r\\nThis is moved to `device.py` to avoid complications with dependencies. This is a bit weird since most of what's in this file has nothing to do with devices. How about moving the schemas to a new module `schemas.py`? Well all shared stuff is within the device context. But I can rename the module if that suits better in you opinion. This schema does not allow extra values, and is used to validate a device based discovery JSON.\\r\\nNote that for the component only the presence of the `platform` option is validated. moved to ~`device.py`~ `const.py` This function replaces all abbreviations. and validates the origin info. Validation of origin info was moved out. When an empty payload is received, this will renerate a config to cleanup all ~siblings~ children of the device., When you write siblings, do you mean children? right, The discovery id's of the device is has been extended with the unique component key, This way it is easy to find and discovered device components. We parse the device JSON (or generate the cleanup instructions) and validate against the device schema. This will allow to override some shared options at component level. Since we allow extra options, it should not be an issue in case an option is not in the component schema. Why would we want to override a shared option? Can you give some example? E.g. a `state_topic` might get it's value from a different topic, In that case, if it is set within the component context  it should override the share context. It was changed this way to address comment:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the shared context that had priority, later I changed this based on:\\r\\n#issuecomment-1915172290\\r\\n @emontnemery There are two circumstances.\\r\\n1. You may have one device that sets a common state_topic / command_topic, and a different device that sets a per-entity state_topic / command_topic - this supports both (no overriding going on).\\r\\n2. You could have a device that sets a state or command topic for the device, but then for specific entities (maybe virtual entities, or who knows), it sets a different state / command topic for that entity, but not the rest of the device.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe former is likely more common.  But the code as written supports both.  ONLY having per-device options would mean a lot of repetition if there are many entities.  ONLY having device entities would make this impossible to use for things that do want different topics per entity.\\r\\nSince we want to support both, having the more specific (entity-based) option override the less specific (device-based) option just makes sense - provides a concrete way to avoid ambiguity. We parse the device discovery and forward the discovery for each component. At component level further schema validation is performed. In case of a single component we just add it to the list of components to process. The component key is used as a `node_id` or if `node_id` was in the discovery as a `sub_node_id`.\\r\\nThe component is retreived from the `platform` option in de component config. This way the `discovery_id` of the `components` of a `device` always contains the discovery_id of the device. shared `device` config is required, and always overrides any component `device` config. shared `origin` info overrides the component origin info (if set). We could choose to make origin info required for the new schema. The `origin` option has been made required for `device` based discovery. For shared options the component config can override the shared config. Returns `{}` in case the `origin` info schema fails. This part is not handled in mixins or the component code, hence it is handled here. I don't understand what you mean, we call `_replace_all_abbreviations` and if that fails we return an empty dictionary. What does that have to do with the origin schema? The origin info is validated against a schema, if that fails, _replace_all_abbreviations fails, and an empty config is returned The same code is is used for the single component discovery, hence we validate the origin schema first, because it is not handled at component level. I have moved the validation of origin info to `_valid_origin_info`, this is only for the current discovery schema (per component).\\r\\nThe `DEVICE_DISCOVERY_SCHEMA` now handles the validation or origin info. It would be nice to do the schema break out in a separate PR. It would really help with testing this so I can focus on making sure I'm profiling the changed code vs the existing code as I spent a bit more time digging around in the profile only to realize it was moved code and not new code.\",\n",

Actually don't store credentials of user  but user Oauth cliend_id and secret and after this the token generated. Alternatively we have to use a unique client_id and secret for all the users and this is not good for us because we have limits on monthly call by client_id We have an Oauth flow, checkout integrations like google, withings, spotify etc. People fill in their own client id and secret and will be redirected to the service to login. After that they will be redirected back to HA.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current approach would also work, but I think this approach would be a better user experience, and it would make HA a bit less dependent on the decisions in the company.

E.g. it is Sunday 08:01 and the next event is next Sunday 07:30 - 8:00 we would\\'ve missed that. I added an extra day to the date range, that should fix that problem. If the event is only at 08:30 we would get it twice, but since we only take the next occurence here, that\\'s no problem.

Not sure I understand what you mean. I\\'m already filtering out any events that are on the current day but have already ended.  Such an example is already part of the tests (Friday iirc) I am referring to the example in my comment. The start datetime is on a day present in the schedule and an event is returned outside of the range. My impression is the steps are this:\\r\\n- Call `async_get_events(2024-02-11 09:00, 2024-02-18 08:00)`\\r\\n- Call `_get_date_range(2024-02-11 09:00, 2024-02-18 08:00)`\\r\\n- _get_date_range yields `2024-02-11 09:00`\\r\\n- Call `_async_get_calendar_event(2024-02-11 09:00`\\r\\n- date.weekday is sunday\\r\\n- returns `CalendarEvent(start=2024-02-11 07:00, end=2024-02-11 07:30`\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe this is prevented and i\\'m missing it. (My impression was that before your change that sunday event was returned outside the range. Now after your change, it returns a sunday event outside of the range and a sunday event within the range.) ah, I thought you were talking about the `property` and not `async_get_events`. Indeed that was possible (and actually I had exactly such a case in my snapshot test) for the function, but not the property. Moved the logic to a separate function, so it\\'s now handled and consistent. Yes i\\'m talking about `async_get_events` which has a start and end range and is what is called by the trigger.\\r\\n\\r\\nI still think there are some cases missed by the current logic.  Given a schedule of \"Every Sunday between 07:00 - 07:30\", I don\\'t think all of these cases are handled correctly:\\r\\n- start: 2024-02-11 06:00, end: 2024-02-18 06:00 => Includes 2024-02-12 07:00 only\\r\\n- start: 2024-02-11 07:15, end: 2024-02-18 06:00 => Includes 2024-02-12 07:00 only\\r\\n- start: 2024-02-11 09:00, end: 2024-02-18 07:15 => Includes 2024-02-18 07:00 only\\r\\n- start: 2024-02-11 09:00, end: 2024-02-18 08:00 => Includes 2024-02-18 07:00 only\\r\\n- start: 2024-02-11 09:00, end: 2024-02-18 06:00 => Includes none\\r\\n- start: 2024-02-11 06:00, end: 2024-02-18 08:00 => Includes both\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the current logic will still include events outside the range when the end date is a day that has an event scheduled, but the calendar event is outside the range.

       " 'A much better option is to have CONF_ADDRESS be either an int or an array, no need for an extra parameter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease remember this needs to be copied for FAN_MODE. Hi @janiversen thanks for the review. With regards to the suggestion, I followed the same approach already implemented for the other parameters, in example [HVAC Mode](#write_registers), target temp and [hvac on off](#write_registers) In those cases, the address is an integer and using that option the user can force the system to use te modbus function write multiple registers (0x10) instead of the single (0x06). So I considered this approach as the \"suggested one\". Why  we should change it only for fan mode?  Because it simplifies the code, and that is the direction we are moving towards....of course not all of the old code is changed at this point in time. And if you look at e.g. the service set point, it does exactly that, can be called with an int or an array. I understand. \\r\\nBefore to apply the change, please, consider that in the future you can remove all the options \"write_registers\" for all except the target temperature, where the list will have a different sense.. (if you approve my PR, of course). This mean that to keep the \"write_registers\" option for all, will keep all the configuration coherent, else, you\\'ll have different meanings of the lists used in the configuration. \\r\\nLet me know\\r\\n \"Coherent\" is not an objective in itself, especially not if it implies expanding the code.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease do not forget, your change is currently not working if you want to use modes....you need to do exact the same for each mode...and that explodes the code.  Basically all these \"mode\" parts (in different parts of climate) it something that needs to change to one uniform way of doing it, without X extra parameters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe change could very well be (for all):\\r\\n\\r\\n- allow int or list in base address.\\r\\n- if list contains 1 element, it will use write_registers\\r\\n- if list contains the exact number of variants (in this case modes) use the correct int as address\\r\\n- if the entry in list is a list with 1 entry use write_registers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not at all user friendly, but as noted earlier yaml is not user friendly....important here is that it is something that can be converted to a config_flow, which will be a lot more user friendly.\\r\\n > * if list contains the exact number of variants (in this case modes) use the correct int as address\\r\\n> \\r\\n> * if the entry in list is a list with 1 entry use write_registers.\\r\\n\\r\\nI really appreciate the condivision of your vision and I imagine that this proposal will make really complex the code. I know that my opinion is not important, but I miss something. Why do you want to move the code there? \\r\\nI mean, if we consider the Fan Mode example, the only need is to have the CONF_ADDRESS managed as int or list of one single int, because do you imagine that also the values will be expressed as list? What is the real use case that I miss?\\r\\n my bad, I took took the modes as separate registers, as you did earlier for target_temperature. Ok. So, should I replace actual implementation by managing int/list (only 1 element) for CONF_ADDRESS?  I was just applying the change when I thought that before to do it, probably I need to more information of the future because here we have mixed CONF_ADDRESS and modes.. \\r\\nActually the component uses only an int (CONF_ADDRESS) for the register, but we could have a list for the values. This because the pb_call accepts a list only for the value. \\r\\nGenerally speaking, the real use cases could include also the the need to write real multiple registers ans so you could have the need to manage a list also as registers. This could increase the complexity of the code, of course, because the options to manage increases. \\r\\n@janiversen, considering the actual code, probably to enable the write_registers support I should keep the CONF_ADDRESS as an int and manage int or list for each of the modes. \\r\\nIf you agree, I change the code in this way, instead of CONF_ADDRESS else please advise me \\r\\n the better option is to have CONF_ADDRESS as an int (write_register) or as a list of one (write_registers).

I hope to be able to split by type, because I found in the local test that after adding new devices, the data of the sensor is classified and displayed on the homepage, and the default display effect looks very good. No. You told me that every channel is their own measuring point and its own physical device. Thus one channel is one device in HA. This also allows the user to rename the device to maybe where they placed the sensor to give it more context. Can I change it this way?\\r\\nThe identifiers are bound to the key of the sensor, which is different for each sensor, so that each entity will be a device. No. This is how our devices work as you can read in our dev docs. This will make this PR way smaller, consistent with the rest of the integrations and easier to manage Can you give me some hints on how to implement this in the code? If i understand correctly you have the main device, and sub devices. Give them all a different identifier and for the sub devices make sure you add the `via_device` and set it to the main device. I think checking the Dev docs on this is the best way. And if you have trouble, let me know and I can think of an example integration for your problem, can't think of any now  Please use `CONF_HOST` (from homeassistant.const) where have the channels gone?

Yes, but the puzzle is not the init itself, but how to change the execution order of the validation calls.. Debugger has been a friend..  The duplicate validator run last, so the value if present is a list. @janiversen When I tested this piece of code on a real env, I obtained an error caused by the iteration over an int, so it seems to me that it run before the validation. Am I wrong? Well your validator changes the config, like some of the others, so it is important it runs after those....if it does not correct it. @janiversen I spent some time using the debugger and also the other validators which change the output (i.e. number_validator, nan, struct_validator..) are called AFTER the duplicate_entity_validator. \\r\\nso it seems the the duplicate validator run as first, not the last. \\r\\nWhat I miss?!\\r\\n\\r\\n You miss that you need to change that. Dear @janiversen I really appreciate your patience and your (+/-) hidden suggestions; I tried to change the code every time you asked and I can assure that imagining what you have in mind was not so easy.

I don\\'t know if it is right, because IMHO it is totally unuseful to check duplicates if the entity itself is wrong, but this is not my matter and I\\'m sure that who wrote that had a good reason. \\r\\nIf you have already an idea on how we should change the whole validation process, please, explain..

       " 'Why is this a template instead of a fixed string? Can you give some example of where it\\'s useful to dynamically change the code format? This seemed to be the most straightforward way to support \"require no code at all to lock, but a certain code to unlock\". Or a well-known short code to lock, but a long (possibly dynamic) one to unlock.\\r\\nFrom a system design perspective, if so desired it is always possible to go to a \"secure\" state (locked) and you need knowledge to go to an \"insecure\" (unlocked) state. Or have it the other way around if the meaning of \"secure\" and \"insecure\" is swapped in a user\\'s context.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis works neatly with the frontend without introducing new attributes like [Template Alarm\\'s code_arm_required](#code_arm_required). OK I see. That makes the PR work around limitations in the lock entity IMHO, something which is not wanted. Please replace the `code_format_template` with a fixed `code_format` and hit the \"Ready for review\"-button when done. Naturally, I beg to differ 😀 I think this makes template locks quite versatile in their application.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is the actual issue here? There are other examples where the current code format for a lock is computed on the fly inside the method, for instance in the implementation of matter locks:\\r\\n\\r\\n#L43-L60\\r\\n\\r\\nHere the return value, at least without forward tracing the code, could change during operation, which is exactly what can happen with a template for lock code formats as well. My conclusion is that there is no actual limitation in the lock entity and thus code formats can be dynamic without any issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan you elaborate? (Marking this PR as Ready for review again in order to make this comment visible) Right, the matter implementation computes the code format, but it seems clear from the code the intention is to do so based on properties of the remote lock device, not based on the state of the lock.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs the main driver of your PR to implement support for dynamic code formats? The long story is that I basically wanted to a) virtually secure certain switches/complex setups and b) have something similar to a switch that properly supports in-between-states. Meaning something complex is turned on (which I don\\'t want to happen by accident and not necessarily by anyone walking through our hallway), and while this is turning on, which can take quite some time, the UI controls display an intermediate state (like the lock that is \"unlocking\" and then is \"unlocked\"). The opposite is not true, so while I whish the turning on to be secured, turning off can happen anytime without securing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat drove me to template locks, which currently don\\'t support codes at all, and to make this available _and_ \"templateable.\" \\r\\n\\r\\nAs far as I see it, the main question is: does any existing code rely on the (undocumented, AFAIK) fact that a code format property of a lock never changes?  \\r\\nI guess the answer is no, because there are places where this can obviously occur, Matter being one example. If no one relies on constant code format, why not make it optionally dynamic for template locks (that target advanced users only) as well? And the format can be based on anything, really, not only locks\\' state.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother application I have in mind is a dynamic automatic parental control where one can use something while parents are at home, but need to enter a code if they are not. (All this applies to control surfaces that are accessible to anyone in the house). OK, I see, your use case is essentially about (ab)using lock entities for things which are not actually locks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think what you want to do is covered here  although there\\'s no solution in that discussion. My personal opinion is that we should allow users to set a flag on any entity marking it as requiring confirmation, optionally with a PIN. Frontend and voice assistants should be aware of that flag and show a confirmation dialog / verbally ask for confirmation.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this PR, I would suggest to remove the templating to get the base functionality - adding code format support to template locks - merged. A follow-up PR could extend the code format with templates, and we can continue this discussion in that PR. It\\'s not more abuse than [using a light to control home theater volume](#theater-volume-control) 😉. I always fancy the template-integration to be something special that exactly enables flexibility like this. It\\'s kind of in its DNA.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI am also on board with adding UI-security measures (UI also meaning interactions by voice assistants) to all interactable entities, also with custom messages as described in the linked frontend issue. However, there are three considerations with this idea and your proposed next steps for this PR (all IMO of course):\\r\\n\\r\\n1. This property (pin required/not required) needs to be templateable; user (or role) specific settings would be nice as I wouldn\\'t bother myself to enter a PIN to enable A/C, for instance, because I usually sometimes kind of tend to know what I do 😉 \\r\\n2. The place where the check happens should be customizable. This means that I expect the actual check (after the _requirement_ of a PIN/Code has been determined) to be offloaded to something else to be able to also support changing/rolling codes. Only supporting a static setting here would again severely limit flexibility.\\r\\n3. Introducing a `code_format` for template locks now would solve about half of my issues, but _if_ later we come to the conclusion that it indeed should be templatable, it would either not fit to the template entities config convention (`_template` suffix) or it would create a second property and deprecate the old one and we\\'d have to think about procedure when both are set and whatnot...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nYou think a discussion on the discord would provide more insights into what others think about this whole ordeal? Would it even make a difference? The template light example is not good, that example should be for a templated number instead; maybe the example was added before we had template number.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo matter that, and no matter the non-lock use case you have in mind, you\\'ve convinced me that there\\'s no reason to not allow templated `code_format`, and I checked with a couple of other core developers who also agree.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan you please add negative tests which show what happens if the template has a syntax error or raises an error during rendering? Will the result be that we accept any code or no code at all or something else?\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, can you double confirm how frontend behaves when the `code_format` attribute changes? We don\\'t need to call super here\\r\\n Nice!\\r\\nPlease customize this so it\\'s clear what template errored, use a translated message with placeholders for the name of the failing template and the error message in the _code_format_template_error:\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething like:\\r\\n Now:\\r\\n![grafik](\\r\\n Why is this change required?

If \"I chimed into the way the other tests in this file use this config preset to assess whether actions are called with correct parameters.\" is not an answer then I don\\'t know what is.\\r\\n\\r\\nI guess you know how the tests work in this file, so what\\'s the matter here?

It's not really needed but we will lose the possibility to change the discovery interval.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, looking at the Gree integration, I had a couple of ideas:\\r\\n* Would be better to use `async_dispatcher_send` when a device is discovered?\\r\\n* Currently the discovery it is done using the `govee_local_api` library (internally it uses a `call_later` on the same Home Assistant event loop) but, since this can be disabled, could be better if the update function is triggered using something like `async_track_time_interval`?\\r\\n Why would one change the discovery interval?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you mean with the config flow can be disabled? Also, Optionsflow should be in a follow up PR. If with the gree config flow no options flow is possible and we still want one, I'd rather fix something in core so we are able to add an options flow after the `super().__init__()`, `self.config_entry` is set to the config entry. Please retype `config_entry` to `ConfigEntry` tho. Checkout the youtube coordinator on how to do that why do we do this? This is an excellent question 😅 I remember writing this in an early draft of the code, but it makes little sense now `CoordinatorEntity` will set the `coordinator` to `self.coordinator` The default implementation is already returning self._attr_unique_id Please remove empty fields. Also remove the quality scale. I would prefer to have that done in a separate PR Please revert this Coordinator is not setup at this point, like never, so we can remove it here. This unload is lacking unloading platforms You can add `entry.async_on_unload(coordinator.cleanup)` in the setup, this removes the need to do it here as well Please check other unload entries, as this is wrong These 3 parameters are unneeded imo This isn't doing anything useful? This should go in the init file This too device_info can be set in the constructor with `_attr_device_info`. Then you can set `_attr_name = None` and the entity will follow the device name It's cleanup. Please fix this in the code or it'll probably stay here forever  I was able to get it wrong also in the library 😓 I'll also fix there\",\n",
       " \"Create one coordinator class per measurement call type instead. Each measurement will have a different return value type that will correspond to the coordinator data type. I think we can make a base class with the default init method and keep it generic via a type var for the coordinator data value. Then we don't need to repeat the init method in every coordinator, unless we need to customize the init method.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNote that I added a default executor job since all the measurement calls are sync. Need to split it up even further than current so makes sense.\\r\\nWe can add the argument always to the base class so then we never need to repeat `__init__` Look at the renault sensor platform for how we can type the entity and entity description generic and have a single description method to calculate the native value. We don't want to create one coordinator per sensor. Multiple sensors will share the same coordinator but just take a different view of the coordinator data. Eg there are three sensors that should use the same swap memory coordinator. I'm not sure we want to request a refresh here. It would mean that there will be at least a second refresh after the cooldown time (10 seconds) if more than one entity shares the same coordinator.\\r\\n\\r\\nProbably refresh the coordinators before creating the entities and then pass each entity its coordinator.  We should make it non protected if it needs to be imported to another module. I don't think argument and type belongs on the coordinator, besides the disk coordinator which needs the argument. For the rest the argument and type are specific for each entity not for each coordinator. The coordinators should just return the measurement from the measurement api call. Then it's up to each entity and its entity description to parse the measurement result and set a state.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe `psutil.net_io_counters(pernic=True)` call just needs to go in one coordinator and all the net io sensors can use that coordinator. I think we should remove argument and type from the common class and just add argument to the disk coordinator. Look at the renault sensor platform that passes an entity to the description value method. I think we can do it like that to be able to set entity attributes and store data that we need.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide note: Calculating state like this isn't really allowed but we should keep it for now. This seems like its going to create a lot more executor jobs which is one of the problems we had with the original design.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe its better to have each sensor flip on parts of the update when its added to hass ? After the first refresh the coordinator won't update if there are no enabled entities attached to it. Oh right, it probably won't matter that much in that case. We already have protection built into the coordinators to avoid accidental synchronization so we shouldn't have a thundering herd problem either This should not be a single function with checks for all entities. Each entity description should have a function that does needed parsing on the coordinator data. Yes. Was just parking it yesterday. Will be individual functions.  Maybe add a comment there is no gather here on purpose to avoid swamping the executor to prevent someone from adding one later Side note: An on/off state for a non binary sensor is weird. Agree We don't need a mixin if we set `kw_only=True`.\\r\\n Maybe put all these calls in a single function that we schedule once on the executor, and return a dict or a dataclass with the result eg? For all three entities (`systemd`, `git`, `python`) I get `process node for argument systemd`\\r\\nSo I'm clearly missing something somewhere but can't see why `entity.argument` always resolves to `systemd` regardless. I'm guessing we're consuming the iterator the first time we iterate it. Copy it to a list in the coordinator if we want to be able to iterate multiple times. Thanks!! Was looking at that far too long. In these functions we know what the generic type is. So we should replace the generic type with the actual type, I think. That should allow us to remove the use of cast below. Why is this function just returning the result of `get_network`? Ie, why do we need it? We don't.

Not trying to make excuses, but I'm an embedded C developer and I'm still learning the subtleties of Python... Thanks for the guidance. I'm not accusing you of making excuses, you can just reply that mypy is annoying and I get that :).\\r\\n\\r\\nI just now see that this was in the switch.py. Does mypy also complain on the select one? Yes, they both need to declare a return value of `Any` to keep mypy happy.  The suggestion you made was for select.py, but switch.py has the same declaration so I was trying to keep them in sync.  I just saw a comment from @jbouwh about modifying the switch.py declaration in a separate PR, so I'll remove that change from this one. Oh, when the changes are this small I don't mind a little code cleanup :) Fixed in a019ea53b7232b2ebcdf8c19d1c787f1a7f52ab1. Oh we already made a separate PR for it so you would not have to do it  Please raise `ServiceValidationError` is the option is not in `PROTECT_MODE_OPTIONS`\\r\\nNote that a translation key can be added to support translations. Thanks for the translation key suggestion.  I added that in 7a031bcff0c9631def3e3968b9fe045a5d322dc9.  I'm glad I did that now because I had to push the values to lower-case to appease one of the linters, and that meant changing the API in my device firmware.  Much easier before it is released.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I add an `else: raise ServiceValidationError` to `async_select_option()`, I can't seem to hit that line in my tests.  If I call `hass.services.async_call()` with an invalid value in a test, something else raises a `ValueError` exception before `async_select_option()` even fires.  It seems like I should just remove the `if option in PROTECT_MODE_OPTIONS:` test altogether because it is always true.  Thoughts? My fault. It seems SelectEntity does a validation check that calls value Error.\\nThis means you can remove the check to see if the option is valid here, and there is no need to raise.\\n Thanks for verifying.  I removed the check in 0a100876bb02c292b07cfc9135615e5f471255f7. Not sure if the typing is correct here. I might have missed that with the Switch PR. Left suggestions to improve the typing.

At the moment, all of the switches have dynamic icons, but I didn't want to make the assumption that would always be the case.  By setting a return value and then optionally overriding it I don't miss the final return value with the two switches I'm currently implementing.  I know it's slightly odd, but can I leave this one alone so I can keep my 100% coverage score? > To add, there are only 2 description types, why do we even fallback to entity description icon\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have plans in the works for adding additional device types that will have switches without dynamic icons.  The fallback is just planning ahead for future additions.  I'm certainly willing to simplify and remove the fallback knowing that I will probably need to put it back in when new switches are added. I went ahead and simplified the icon property in 8ad8014c75e5574b29cf506bd7a03f402b738ccc just so the unnecessary fallback case isn't an issue here. Please handle this from the coordinator update that is called instead. The code could be moved to the `DROPEntity` base entity class Here you can set `_attr_icon`, make constants for the icons. For binary sensors you could make a mapping. @jbouwh  Sorry, I don't think I'm understanding this.  Are you saying I should create a new switch subclass in entity.py and move the icon property there?  Something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n... and then use `DROPSwitchEntity` in switch.py?  Would this also apply to the other properties (such as `is_on()`) in switch.py?  You also mentioned binary sensors; do you want me to refactor the (already merged) sensors and binary sensors as part of this PR as well?\\r\\n\\r\\nI guess I don't understand why it is a problem to have the `icon` property in switch.py.  It appears the most integrations do it that way and since it is using `self.is_on` to determine state, it is already changing based on updates from the DROP hub via the API.  It seems like a lot of unnecessary complexity, and I feel like switch properties belong in switch.py.\\r\\n Left some suggestion on your last commit. Lets use `DROPSwitchEntity` as you initially implemented.  The state will be `UNKNOWN`. To test the state update simulate the response using ` async_fire_mqtt_message` or update the state result to `STATE_UNKNOWN`.

Changed in 00255a784e537b659831511f69d179a6c646d4bc. Can we have a keyed form here to like we have for ICON. Consider constants for the states to be exposed by the API (can be added later).\\r\\nWe can just use `.get` so it returns `None` as default. @jbouwh  I made the change in 84fe270e264702233497985739d2cc79226189cd, but I had to include a reflexive mapping for None to keep mypy happy.  Please let me know if there's a better way to do this. Left some suggestions Implemented in fe7791d5eecacc13382467baaffac4cddd05e01f. Why are we setting a state? That shouldn't be needed.

I am not an expert of the hass internals at all and unfortunately the documentation seems kind of poor when it comes to describing how all the config setup works internally.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\\'s what I understand:\\r\\nThere\\'s an old and a new way of setting up components and entries. The modern way to set up integrations for platforms is to forward the entry setup to the corresponding platforms like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the `notify` integration seems to be the only one that is stuck with the legacy way of setting up things. This means that the above call will fail with `AttributeError: module \\'homeassistant.components.notify\\' has no attribute \\'async_setup_entry\\'` for notify.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the reason why for example the slack integration separates the behavior for notify like this:\\r\\n#L72\\r\\nNote the `if platform != Platform.NOTIFY` and the `async_load_platform` call above.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis seems to be a common way to setup notify platforms, here they even have an explanation:\\r\\n#L137\\r\\n\\r\\n`no entry support for notify platform yet, have to use discovery to load platform.`\\r\\n\\r\\nSeems everyone else does the same. You can also check the `discord` integration or others.\\r\\nThis is why I use `discovery.async_load_platform`.\\r\\nNow let\\'s come back to how this is related to keeping `def async_setup`:\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the above method which you suggested to remove, I store the hass `config` in `hass.data[DATA_HASS_CONFIG]`.\\r\\nLater on, this variable is needed in the call to `discovery.async_load_platform`, see the requirement here: \\r\\n#L154\\r\\n\\r\\nHence, it seems I cannot remove `async_setup`. Let me know if I\\'m missing something here.  Remember when I said that a notify integration to config flow isn\\'t that different? I take that back. This is awful 😂 (not because of you btw, you\\'re putting in great effort, I just don\\'t like how it differs from the rest)\\n\\nLike I\\'ve seen some pass by but I did not know all these pieces were needed. So I guess I\\'m also still learning here. Can we mark this resolved? I\\'m on mobile right now, I\\'ll drive into this tomorrow If we don\\'t need to set anything we can also choose to don\\'t set anything.\\r\\n\\r\\n But we do need the `entry.data`. This is used when setting up the `SIPCallNotificationService`, which gets the credentials from the config flow through that. But you\\'re also passing the entry data in the discovery stuff, can\\'t you use that instead? Ok gotcha now. You are totally right, let me fix this. I don\\'t know how SIP works, but is it maybe possible to check beforehand if we can connect to the server? To check if our credentials are still valid and we know the server is online and reachable? This can be very nice in both the init and in the config flow. Well... It would be doable if my nanosip implementation also supported the REGISTER method which is used to receive calls. But the aim of all this is to make it as simple as possible. \\r\\nSo we can only verify the credentials by making a call, and I guess we don\\'t want to do that during the config flow. I mean yes we like simple, but we love this as well. If you can guard people from setting up a config entry without ever testing it the data is correct, that\\'d be the best. Otherwise you\\'re getting issues like \"yea I have this entry setup and my device doesn\\'t appear\".\\n\\nThe config flow is the most user friendliest way of saying to the user they f*cked up and that it\\'s their problem For this, I will need to make some changes to `nanosip`. It still won\\'t support `REGISTER`, but the config flow can allow the user to make a test call and show if there were errors. As you\\'re the one knowing a lot about this, what would your ideal way of checking this be? You said about register, what does that do and would that work here? Why/why not?\\n\\nA test call would be nice, it\\'s something.

It goes through `slugify` to make the service name.\\r\\n Interesting one, I\\'ll try to find some people to discuss this with. Thanks Yeah it\\'s a bit annoying, because if the user changes the `title` of the config entry, it won\\'t change the underlying name of the service to call. Would be nice if the user could change that too I know for a fact that there are some ideas to phase out this type of notify services and introduce some kind of NotifyEntity to call a generic service onto an entity instead of having a service per entity, that wouldve been ideal here Let me know when there\\'s a shiny new notify implementation ;)  Remove empty fields Makes sense, I will remove those.

I kinda feel like they should be part of the library, even tho they aren\\'t part of the connection to the service it could be used in combination with an abstraction to return an object with full data What do you think @bachya? Do you want me to put it in `aioambient`? @thomaskistler I\\'m aligned with them living in the library. 👍🏻 Why do we need this? I added it as a user convenience. We create and suggest a 3-4 letter name/mnemonic for the station(s) that are added. Instead of having the sensor names show up as sensor.bunny_ranch_weather_station_tempf, they will show up with something like sensor.brws_tempf. It\\'s not strictly necessary. I can remove it if you feel strongly about it. I prefer the first one actually and people can rename the device themselves if they think it\\'s too long Ok. Removed. Removed. Why do we convert a static value? Fixed. So if I understand correctly, someone chooses a location and radius and we get all stations from inside that radius and ask the user to add it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means 1 config entry -> n stations.\\r\\n\\r\\nHave you considered 1 config entry -> 1 station? I have this setup at WAQI. This way you can avoid people adding stations twice. Someone chooses a location and radius and we will display all stations that are discovered inside that radius. The user can then select whether they want to pick a single station (in which case we add one config entry that directly tracks this one station), or whether they want to track multiple stations (in which case we will add one config entry that \"averages\" the data from all selected stations). The latter is really important because many of the local private weather stations are not setup ideally and you can have significant outliers in terms of temperature, wind, and precipitation. But then my question is, home assistant has a lot of different features, why don\\'t we let the user do this themselves? Then they can also exclude stations themselves etc scan_interval is static, no need to make it a parameter Fixed. Fixed. You can overwrite the type of the config entry in the coordinator. checkout the youtube coordinator for an example Fixed. Fixed. No? Have you generated translations? Yes.

This is also being passed on to the async setup entries in the other platforms, so is there any need to store it here? I think there are 2 things we should try and catch.

The service is down. In this case we want to raise a ConfigEntryNotReady exception. This makes it retry a bit later again.\\n2. The stations don't exist anymore. (I'm just doing a guess this is something that can happen). In this case, our config entry just doesn't work.

But I note that this wasn't obvious this was possible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI've now implemented the ability for the flow to regularly send the auth request every second whilst we're waiting for the access token to improve the user experience, which should handle both the prompt not appearing (or briefly appearing and then immediately disappearing), but also removes the time sensitivity that was there previously.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you find that you still need to send an invalid token I can modify this to do so.   Can we add a function `async def async_unload_entry` too? The way in which we distinguish between these two cases is not correct, because it makes no difference to the user.\\r\\nInstead, we should distinguish between:\\r\\n1. The import is done, and the user should remove YAML\\r\\n2. Something went wrong when doing import (if this can happen, for example in the authorize step, and we can't leave the flow import for the user to finish) If this is only here to make mypy happy, do like this instead:\\r\\n Please remove these constants, they're only used once, in config_flow.py Move this to config_flow.py Do we really need these helpers which are only used once? Not necessarily, but I was following the same pattern that is found in the [samsungtv](#L16), and [webostv](#L16) components which perform near-identical tasks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I didn't want to break existing convention, but it might be worth refactoring all of these helpers so that the core logic can be shared. Does the dependency bump need to go hand in hand with adding the config flow? If not, please move the dependency bump to a separate PR. Yes, the dependency bump is here because we've added the `query_device_info` function that is used in the config_flow to get the UUID, model name and friendly name and of the TV. I think we should also raise an issue here, telling the user the import is pending because we can not connect to the TV and will be retried, the issue should be removed when import suceeds. There's no reason the unique_id should be optional?\\r\\n Agreed - this is left from the original implementation that didn't migrate the YAML (and discover the unique_id) we know this entity has a unique id, hence there's no need to check this Sure, I think this is mainly here to keep the type checker happy (and is the same structure as the samgsung and webostv and webostv components) but I can instead turn this into a `TYPING_CHECKING` assert check instead.

Are you sure this is required? My belief was that having `mqtt` as a dependency would be enough when using `async_setup_entry`. The Tasmota integration is not doing this either.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a core reviewer with more experience can verify this probably. I think it is cleaner as-is.  If I disable or remove the MQTT integration I see the expected \\'MQTT integration is not available\\' entries in the log at startup.  Without this test, I see stack traces instead as the MQTT subscriptions fail. nit: you could also move LOGGER to const.py and import it where required.\\r\\n\\r\\n I actually started with the logger defined in const.py but later moved it to each module so that log entries include the module name, which I found helpful.  A cursory survey of other integrations shows that this approach is very common, so I\\'d like to leave it as-is if possible. \\r\\n\\r\\nDo you need a constructor here? Should be fine with having them as class variables. You could also think about setting them to `str | None` and setting the initial value to None instead of an empty string. It works fine without the constructor and initial values were changed to None where appropriate.  Changes in 653064f6c4ebe83b575342e0dd428cd0436a34d8. Is there no way to set this up manually, in case discovery doesn\\'t work? No, there really isn\\'t.  The MQTT discovery payloads include a device ID number used by DROP to address individual devices.  (e.g., you can have 50 leak detectors on one DROP system)  There isn\\'t any way for a user to be able to predict that device ID number, and it\\'s used to construct the MQTT topics used by the device.

For setting the value, the app shows the time period as a slider and defaults to 3h. For displaying the current manual boost, it shows the time it is active until. The API works by timestamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nI added the extra processing required for time period to avoid having to use as much jinja in automations, but I can see a use case for either. e.g. Set temperature for 3h while clothes are drying or set temperature until 5pm when finishing work.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo set until a given time today, jinja would still be required to work out the date, but it would be much simpler than calculating the time period (e.g. `{{ states(\\'sensor.date\\') + \\' 17:00:00\\' }}`).\\r\\n\\r\\nLikewise, having a service to boost for a given timespan would potentially satisfy most use cases in the UI. Working only by datetime would involve some complex jinja to calculate the correct end time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe HA could handle this automatically in future by having the datetime selector work with times relative to the point when they are triggered, but that is a very different feature.

You could keep a local list in this platform with added devices.

I thought this would be more flexible for users, but it\\'s fine for me to omit the name completely and set it based on country/subdivision. OK, in that case my thought is that given the integration is using unique ids, users are able to use the built in features from Home Assistant to rename the calendar or the entity id like they can with any other entity.

If the bump goes in without this change the existing authorisation flow in async_step_user will break.

My impression is that this returns an unregister callback. at the moment (_only the `Proximity` entity is there_) there is no configuration entry, nor is the Proximity entity configurable via the UI, IMO those this support of unregistration needs to be added at least when the configflow (_those the config entry_) is introduced to the integration. Is this valid? The default is `None` but not represented in the type? should be more clear or better resolved with 9c0bdb3 Given this is not polling, and registering its own callbacks for tracking state changes, i this really meeting the spirit of a `DataUpdateCoordinator`? It seems like it may just be its own object for tracking state so i\\'m wondering if perhaps its not getting value from subclassing this, or if its not a good idea to subclass. i considered to go with `DataUpdateCoordinator` because it already brings everything needed, so registered entities get notified and values updates as soon as the data update on the coordinator was successful. this is also to be seen as prework for adding the sensor entities. What does it mean to have new state? I\\'m wondering if it means the data is unavailable and should return `None` vs preserving existing data. Curious to learn more about when this can happen and what it means. this all is moving existing code, so tbh i\\'m not sure in which circumstances the `new_state` could be `None`, but it seems to be foreseen, as the `async_track_state_change` use it as signature for the to be called function:\\r\\n#L170 Agreed, I see that now, thanks. Are these devices or entities? Given its pulling `hass.states` i\\'m assuming they are entities, so wondering if the variables should be renamed, or if there is something else here specific to home assistant devices.\\r\\n\\r\\nI realize this is moving existing code so it could also be future cleanup. you are right, these are actually entities of type `person` or `device_tracker` ... but as you mentioned, this is moving existing code, therefore i tried to change only the needed parts and leave the rest as it is In these cases where the return values are creating new data, I don\\'t think it\\'s worth updating all the fields in a local variable. I\\'d suggest removing `data` then returning a new dict like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSame below as well. --> 258d5b3 Consider defining a dataclass with the 3 fields as the return value instead. It can help enforce types (like elsewhere I saw there were some calls to convert the return values to strings) and it can handle the default values cases. i already tried to define an own dataclass for this, but TBH did not get it work nor get mypy happy 🙈 \\r\\nbut yes, this should be done ... will try again --> 005ba6d i think this check could already be handled by the `async_check_proximity_state_change` above, to avoid unnecessary state change triggers to registered coordinator entities in case data are not changed anyway (_same counts below_) --> d88a9c9 This isn\\'t a config entry setup so we can\\'t use this coordinator method. 3ac7fc09475e8f2d31db690c3472809dd00a3646 The `async_added_to_hass` method should be called before the first default state write. f2d551a0d92caff4d695c297772d1facc4b317fc I think this constitutes a side effect. I suggest we break it out to a method that we can call specifically to setup the tracking. Use a walrus so we don\\'t need to access the attribute again below. Use an f-string instead of string concatenation. Can the proximity be 0?

You don't have a reauth flow yet, so this would raise an error. I think you should raise `ConfigEntryError` I think we should not put json data in state attributes as this isn't user friendly as it's shown in the UI.

Eg: 7.1 configuration has different patterns, so 11 speakers are available, but only 8 would be in use. So some options. The Sony 'Music Center' app shows all 11 for me, with the 3 I don't use greyed out.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat makes the option more viable. Not sure what a soundbar looks like for speaker settings, but it would have been ugly to create 27 entities when it is probably just Left, Right, and Center, maybe a Subwoofer. Maybe create one Home Assistant device per speaker in use and connect the settings entities to the corresponding device? Mark the entities as entity category config.  There is an unfinished PR #63145 which aimed to add separate entities for settings, but it was abandoned. Maybe it's worth checking out if reviving it would make sense? Wow, that is a big change but would improve the integration. I will close this PR and when I get some time look at PR #63145. Thanks. Yeah, maybe it was a bit too much in a one go indeed.. It's probably better to make this by refactoring to use the `DataUpdateCoordinator` with one platform, and then improve platform-by-platform to speed up the review. Some of the code introduced in that PR might also be better suited to be included directly in the python-songpal.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm not sure if @Flameeyes is still interested on working to get these changes in, but as my old soundbar seems to be still working, I can help you with some testing & code reviews as needed. Yeah, I would break it up into many smaller changes, so that it can be chipped away at. My biggest issue is that I will now need to learn the ins and outs of Hass, instead of a small copy of something that is already there :)\\r\\n\\r\\nI also don't really need this as I can already do it another way, but could be useful for others.

       " 'Can you add a comment about what this is doing? Want to extract a constant here? Seems worth extracting a constant for 90 and giving it a helpful name (MAP_REFRESH_INTERVAL or CACHE_INTERVAL something more accurate) It would be good to also exercise the image fetch side of this since it has interesting code in it and it can get the coverage numbers up. I was playing with this last week, something like:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThen it could also be possible to start `patch`ing things and playing with the `should_update` logic as well. Partially implemented - haven\\'t added anything for patching should update yet - not 100% best way to tackle that yet tbh I realize this roborock API is probably a little \"unique\", but perhaps you can explain to me what is happening here. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt loops over maps and returns an entitiy for each one loading each map. But then it also loads the current map (is this /again/ or the only time else?), but doesn\\'t add any extra entities for that last map call?\\r\\n\\r\\nI think adding a little more to the pydoc about how this works as well as elaborating on why it has to be synchronous (e.g. because the server can only load one map per device at a time?) would be useful documentation. Exactly - only one map per device at a time. I\\'ll add a bunch of comments Given the name \"update\" has a specific name for entities and this uses an update coordinator, would a name like `is_cache_expired` be more accurate? My impression is that `ImageEntity.__init__` calls this function. Is this needed? Don\\'t think so - I added it when I was first debugging and running into some issues. Check out #image which says that the frontend will only fetch the image when this property changes, and it is not expected to update this from within this call.\\r\\n I don\\'t think this has been addressed to follow the developer guidance. Ah I thought I handled this - my bad. But to be honest, I don\\'t really get what the docs means is best practice in this case.  I think it is saying that the data fetch should not be happening in the image serving path, but instead should happen when data and state is normally updated (e.g.  `async_update` etc).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo as a concrete example of what it is saying could be appropriate could be: \\r\\n- from `_handle_coordinator_update` start another background task to fetch the cloud image, then as that finishes it sets the image update time.   Maybe the logic in `is_cache_expired` needs to run there and adaptively fetch? My understanding is that you\\'re trying to only update the map when it has interesting changes when the vacuum is running. Perhaps this means some of the caching logic isn\\'t needed, and it just turns into logic of when to fetch new data.\\r\\n- fetch from the coordinator. this could put all the fetching in one place, but then maybe you have less control e.g. to disable the entity to stop map fetching if you don\\'t want it Yeah is_cached_expired only updates the map when it is interesting.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m still a bit confused\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the issue is - the frontend will repeatedly call async_image if i refresh or open up the image, it doesn\\'t seem to care about image_last_updated OK.. maybe its more about subscribing to updates and knowing when to refresh rather than to avoid refreshing too often. You may want to kick off the image fetch when the coordinator update finishes, then update the image and state at the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Overall the down side is the map will be getting refreshed when the robot is active even if nobody is looking, but that doesn\\'t seem so bad given its only when the robot is active.) I don\\'t fully follow the docs logic though still\\r\\n\\r\\nasync_image gets called whenever I look at the image, if I handle updating the image there and also setting last_image_updated there, then it kind of solves all of the problems, no?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe map will get refreshed when someone looks at it and it needs to and the last_image_updated reflects when the image was last updated. But i\\'m still not sure what last_image_updated is actually used for\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps I do what fritz is doing?\\r\\n\\r\\n It may be that the frontend is not yet taking advantage of this, but it is the currently specified API contract that it can if it needs to.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, what fritz is doing is fine in general, but the complexity added in your case is the active map is determined by the update coordinator so I assume you\\'ll want to run after it has the latest active map data. Should be resolved now Thanks, the comments are really helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo technically, you could skip some calls here in cases where the current map is not changing and things are already loaded? Given there is a pretty huge sleep here, i\\'m wondering if there is a common case that has a fast path: For example, is it common to only have one map? Sorry to jump in but I\\'m also very interested to this great feature. \\r\\nTo answer you last question I think many people have one map, but as soon as your house has 2 floors or there are stairs/steps the vacuum can\\'t overcome, than you certainly have more than one map.  Yeah I now check if we only have one map for this device and then if we do - I don\\'t bother changing maps or sleeping\\r\\n\\r\\nI can probably take it a step further by doing the cur_map first, then doing any other maps Cool, this is great. You could also consider doing the current map last since i believe it needs to be restored at the end anyway. It might mean there are fewer places to have the multimap load call (just in the loop is ok) Having it last would actually slow us down I think\\r\\n\\r\\nWith two maps:\\r\\n\\r\\nCur map = 0 \\r\\n\\r\\nDon\\'t change maps, as we are already on cur map.\\r\\nDon\\'t sleep\\r\\nParse map\\r\\n\\r\\nChange to map = 1\\r\\nSleep\\r\\nParse map\\r\\n\\r\\nChange to map 0\\r\\n\\r\\nsleeps = 1\\r\\nMap changes = 2\\r\\n\\r\\nvs\\r\\n\\r\\nChange map to map 1\\r\\nSleep\\r\\nParse map\\r\\n\\r\\nChange map to map 0\\r\\nsleep\\r\\nParse map\\r\\n\\r\\ndon\\'t change map\\r\\n\\r\\nSleep = 2\\r\\nMap change = 1\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are less map changes, but we have to sleep more times, which slows us down Got it, thank you. Is it worth skipping updates when `is_map_valid` is False? (no changes because its not cleaning, or map is not active, etc) That makes sense to me - changed. Should the cached map be reused when the image hasn\\'t been updated since the last call? I believe so- that should be what is happening This comment looks stale since i think this is the first call.  Perhaps the positioning changes slightly given the update coordinator is now happening?',\n",

Its fine for this PR, next PR should be to create an `entity.py` for a shared base class ie `IdenDeskEntity` before adding any more platforms @bdraco  I was now looking into this for another PR, but I am not sure what the IdasenDeskEntity class would have. Only a single line for the `self._attr_device_info = device_info` ? Because everything else is not common for the current platforms. If there isn't anything common yet then it might not worth be doing until there is.  Usually at some point there is #has_entity_name-true-mandatory-for-new-integrations\\n\\nYou can use has entity name instead  If unset uses this already #L442 oh, nice! If unset, uses this already #L565 We usually sort these in order A future improvement would be to make the button unavailable when its already connected or disconnected Good idea.

Maybe the service handler should pick from available forecasts in the priority order hourly, twice daily, daily? @gjohansson-ST WDYT? I don't see a reason to limit this.

Obsolete by implementing daily forecasts This is already checked in the schema, it only allows 1..216 I'm not sure we should include calculations in the service parameters. I think calculations should be kept in a template as different calculations may be wanted by different users. Calculations are not dependent on the service result, but could be anything. Filtering is more dependent on the the service and service result, so is more acceptable as service parameters. Agree. The output can contain both min and max. Possibly also avg. WDYT? No, I don't think we should have any calculations in services. My idea was to retrieve the extreme values via a service and make all my sensors with templates redundant. If we do not use the calculation in services, this service is useless.\\n\\nWe could implement the hour filter in the normal forecast service instead. I think it would still make sense to extract a single attribute with a time-limit. Removed calculations and renamed service When can this happen? We require at least one of the supported features when registering the service. Min max isn't used. I also still think the user should be able to select which forecast to pick from + limit_hours should be renamed to be a fit for all three types. What's extra?\",\n",

Do you mean the order of the asserts? Should the check for flow result be always the last assert in the test function? Or do you mean something else? you only check for form, but we want to see that after an error message, the flow is able to succeed Sorry, I\\'m a bit lost here. I checked a few other integrations and didn\\'t see much of a difference. The config flow of Minecraft Server either is successful (`CREATE_ENTRY`) or it cannot connect. In that case the same `FORM` is shown only with a difference, that the error message is shown additionally. In that form the user can correct the user input and retry. It\\'s something that we like new tests to have, to avoid code that could stick around and put the config flow in some kind of lock. So the trick is to finish the FORM, so it will become either a CREATE_ENTRY or an ABORT My problem is, that I don\\'t abort my config flow, therefore (if I understood correctly) I can never reach the ABORT state. Let me try to make this more clear with screenshots.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the initial form.

Hmm, I just checked some code and not every integration does this, and I think I remember this as a good practice to do. One reason I can imagine is for example auth. If someones password has changed, we don't want to start up everything and retry the old password every poll. If we can do a simple request at start to check if the credentials are valid, we can continue, if they are not, we return False and we just tell HA that the integration isn't ready but won't be coming up without user inteference (but later we might replace this with the reauth flow) Default can be omitted, everyone's network is built differently, and I would imagine that someone working with HA at least know what a host is. The reason why I considered adding the default was to provide a hint for the https port, but I will add this to the documentation, it seems a better place. I know that this is from the hassfest scaffold, but I think you can just move this into the `async_step_user` there isn't a lot of added overhead. what are we trying here?

This comment is right as well, except for the fact, you don't have reauth yet.

The library doesn't seem to have been updated to allow this. I recommend reading our library guide on how to structure the library and client:\\r\\n\\r\\n I've reworked the library according to the documentation. I actually like this approach.\\r\\nEverything works fine now except of the websocket connection. It's not possible to establish it and I don't get an error. I've tried very long, but wasn't able to get it working. Could you have a look at the library, please?\\r\\n#L371\\r\\n I don't think you should make a loop when connecting the websocket. Just have a `connect` method that connects the websocket and stores a reference to it on the client.\\r\\n\\r\\n#L148-L160\\r\\n\\r\\nThen have another method `listen` that fetches incoming messages and iterates over them and handles them. It's this method that the library user should create a background task for.\\r\\n\\r\\n#L374\\r\\n\\r\\nThe benefit of separating the `connect` and `listen` methods is that we can make sure we can connect the websocket with a timeout before we create the task that should listen for websocket messages. If we can connect the websocket the chances are high that the websocket communication will work. If we fail to connect during the timeout, we want to raise `ConfigEntryNotReady` and try again later automatically.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide notes:\\r\\n1. It looks like there's a double call to update data callbacks:\\r\\n#L380-381\\r\\n#L342\\r\\n\\r\\n2. I'd remove the schedule immediately parameter. The library user can call the callback themselves if needed.\\r\\n#L74 If we create a `connect` method in the library for the websocket, there should also be a `disconnect` method for the websocket. There is now a `close` method Is the token and user id optional? If we know that the key is in the dict, we should use `dict[key]` and not `dict.get(key)`. No, it's not optional. I changed it. Is the user id friendly for the user to read? If so, we could use that as title to let them distinguish between config entries. It's not user friendly. But we can get some user information out of the JWT and make an individual for each config entry. See:\\r\\n I looked at the library. It currently doesn't consistently use the aiohttp client session that is provided when instantiating the abstract auth class. The library should use that provided client session for all requests made. It's ok to create a default aiohttp client session if no session is provided by the library user.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also suggest dropping or making optional the task that gets the status. The library user can do that. In Home Assistant we can use the update coordinator here to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can also use the coordinator and set updated data when the websocket callbacks with updated data. There's this coordinator method:\\r\\n\\r\\n#L400-L402\\r\\n\\r\\nThen we can remove the callback registration from the entities, and just do that in the coordinator instead. The coordinator will update all coordinator entities when the coordinator is updated.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also suggest being consistent in the library with exceptions and logging.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Debug logging is always ok.\\r\\n- Errors that happen in non background tasks are preferably raised as library specific exceptions and not logged. Let the library user decide how to handle the error and if they want to log it.\\r\\n- In background tasks raised exceptions are not as useful, unless we make sure that the library user can handle the exception. One way to do that is to let the library user create and handle the task, ie just make a coroutine method that listens for the websocket messages and let the library user create the task for that. This way the library user can easier react to exceptions and decide how to handle them, eg re-connecting with a backoff, like what is done when Home Assistant raises `ConfigEntryNotReady`. We also need to clean up running tasks on Home Assistant stop event. Search for `EVENT_HOMEASSISTANT_STOP` for examples. These dataclasses should not be in Home Assistant but in the library. Why do we set it to empty string? I'd not use empty string to mean something in the library. I suggest making a helper method on the `mower` class in the library that takes `ws_data` and updates the mower attributes. But then I would have to pass the polled data from the coordinator to the library. Wouldn't that be too complicated, without a real benefit? No, I suggest we pass the websocket update data, ie the `MowerData` instance  to a method on the existing stored `MowerData` instance. The benefit is that the library takes care of the details of how to apply the updated websocket data.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively since the library already stores the `MowerData` instances on the client, the websocket could update them directly and just let the library user know which mower was updated.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, I suggest storing the `MowerData` instances in a dict instead of a list, if the `id` of the mower data instance is unique. That way we can easily look up a specific mower data instance if we have the id. Okay, got it. If this just stores the callback reference, we probably don't need to do it after every connect call, but just once for the coordinator. Or is the callback unregistered if the connection is lost?

I'm not opposed to extending the turn_off functionality, but I do think it deserves its own PR.\\r\\nThis PR is intentionally narrow, its focus is to just provide more consistency, where if the climate has both turn_on and turn_off, it follows that it should have toggle as well.\\r\\nMaking turn_off function better is in my view orthogonal to this, and can be done later if the decision to pursue it is made. > What do we do if OFF is NOT in the HVAC modes?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe raise and fail the service, as discussed.

The sync version is needed to integrate with 3rd party libraries which do not themselves use `asyncio` An alternative is to do the same implementation as `ToggleEntity`:\\r\\n\\r\\n This seems like a valid assumption, we should document `turn_off`, `turn_on` and `toggle` here  and for turn_off mention the HVAC mode should be set to `HVACMode.Off` Do you agree with #discussion_r1353410885? If so, I could add something like that to the docs. Why do we need to allow overriding these, can't we make them `@final`? Integrations interact with devices that often have some form of native TOGGLE command, it then might make sense to use it to the integration author, instead of relying on checking state and then sending TURN_ON or TURN_OFF.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the achieved functionality, you are right that it probably should never be actually necessary to override it. But the exact same argument applies to `async_turn_off`. There is an obvious use case for overriding `async_turn_on`, namely if your device provides a way to turn on without explicitly setting mode of operation (usually setting the one it had before being turned off). But there is no obvious necessity to ever override `async_turn_off` - its operation should be the same as setting mode to `HVACMode.OFF`, which is exactly what our base implementation does already.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only reason I see someone might need to override `async_turn_off` is when they are dealing with some very weird device, that does not technically support turning off, but kind of does. For instance a device that only supports two modes: `[HVACMode.COOL, HVACMode.FAN_ONLY]`. It might make sense then to interpret the second one as a sort of pseudo-off. And then you would need to override `async_turn_off` and `async_toggle` as well. In general overriding `async_toggle` seems to be actually necessary in exactly the same (extremely rare) situations where overriding `async_turn_off` is necessary. So if we were to make those functions final, we should do the exact same to TURN_OFF.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd I feel like both are unnecessarily restrictive to integrations authors, while providing negligible benefits in general. Like I said the main reason to allow overriding is to more closely mirror in code what actual devices are typically supporting, and toggle seems like a common enough functionality.  So to sum up, I think our advice for a typical climate integration should be:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Override (async or sync) `turn_on` if your device supports native TURN_ON. Make sure that `hvac_mode` will (eventually) be correct as well.\\r\\n\\r\\n- Override (async or sync) `turn_off` if your device supports native TURN_OFF. Make sure to set `hvac_mode` to `HVACMode.Off`. In `set_hvac_mode` make sure setting it to `HVACMode.Off` does the exact same thing (probably you can just call `turn_off` from there).\\r\\n\\r\\n- Override (async or sync) `toggle` if your device supports native TOGGLE. In that case make sure that TURN_ON and TURN_OFF are supported as well. OK, this makes sense.\\r\\nCan you please open and link to a PR of  which explains this? Let's explain this:\\r\\n Instead of adding this, and the corresponding helper to detect if turn off is supported, I'd suggest we wait for  and then rebase this PR to use the new feature flags. Does that seem OK @arturpragacz ? What do you think about doing the reverse, that is merge this first and then use those helpers for the checking in  ? That would make no sense as we should use the feature flags so I would then have to remove these checks in the other PR. \\nAnyhow it's shortly finished so you don't need to wait long to finalize. 👍  @gjohansson-ST You would use exactly those checks to set the flags for the back compat.

But just to note that, at some point, the API *will* accept the unit field. I think it is even in the API documentation already (but it might be broken in API v3, whereas older API versions have been sunset). I don't think you need to exclude these from coverage, they will be covered just by importing them? What's this for? It doesn't seem to be used?

I think you may want `enter` here.\\r\\n\\r\\n Why do we set a unique id if we only allow one config entry? And the inverse question, why only allow one config entry if we can set a unique id? Second question first: I first set this up with a unique id then saw the service call adds tasks without referencing a config entry or entity, and so that looked like a problem.\\n(The config entry however does reference a project name, so it could be possible perhaps to infer but that seemed sketchy).\\n\\nFirst question: However, I thought it might be possible to add more config entries in the future if the service changes or is deprecated so I left the unique id. I didn't think it hurts, is there a down side?\\n\\nAs we talk through, I also realize this could potentially be updated in the future to support re-auth updating the API key so maybe this isn't a valid in unique id.  I was thinking of it like an oauth client id but realize how it's not really like than. Given that, perhaps needs to be removed anyway. I'm not sure what, then, could be a unique id but theoretically I'd like this to be able to support multiple accounts since once the service is fixed there's no big reason it couldn't otherwise.\\n\\n Ok. Yeah, I don't think token is a good unique_id since we want to be able to re-authenticate without changing unique_id.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'd migrate the service to an entity service. The service call targets a specific project which equals an entity, right? Then we don't need to worry about unique_id for the config entry for the sake of the service. Will remove the unique id...\\n\\nYeah entity service sounds right. When I did the same thing for Google calendar, it needed to be a new service with a new name etc and s deprecation period before removal of the old service? That is, it can't be immediately moved.\\n\\nI'm thinking here that using a new Todo entity service may work...\\n\\nAm I thinking about that right or is there a shortcut? Yeah, it will need to be a new service so we can keep the old one around and create a repair issue when the old service is called, telling users to use the new service instead. The entity service will require an entity target so we can't reuse the old service name if we want old service calls to still work.\",\n",

My advice would be to add `_attr_has_entity_name = True`, add a device (service) (without a name) and then set `_attr_name = None`. Check IPMA for an example. This way the name of the config entry is used as name for the entity, so if someone changes the config entry name, they automatically get their weather renamed #has_entity_name-true-mandatory-for-new-integrations Idem Idem Consider adding tests as they reduce the amount of regressions It would be cleaner to put the data in the coordinator so you only have to pass around one object You could make a \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThan you can replace all the `self.coordinator.data` calls with `self.data`\\r\\n\\r\\nIts a tiny bit slower but makes all the properties a lot more readable You might also want something that like this to avoid writing out all the currentWeather gets\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

The reauth still might need some work when looking at logging in with the right account (for example, you create the config with account A, and reauth with acount B).
